	abstract = {Allelopathy is a biochemical interaction mechanism among plants that is considered a form of defensive chemical plant adaptation. Produced by a plant, biomolecules are released, on this phenomenon, into the environment and they influence the growth and development of the neighboring plants. The seed germination and early development of seedlings are used to evaluate the allelopathic effect and is often used plant extracts or isolated allelochemicals. The test plants are Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty and Paspalum millegrana Schrad species, aromatic medicinal plants of the Poaceae family. They were introduced on San Francisco waterfront aimed at increasing soil cohesion and stabilization of the slope, however it was possible to realize few species develop in the stretch where vetiver was introduced, signaling possible allelopathic effects. The study also was done with the native plant paspalum, because vetiver is an exotic plant. The objective of this study was to evaluate the allelopathic effect of Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty and Paspalum millegrana Schrad species in Lactuca sativa L. seed-tests. Aqueous extracts were prepared of two techniques (maceration and infusion), from the aerial part and the root in three concentrations, 1\%, 3\% and 5\%, for both species, totaling 25 treatments. The physical and chemical parameters of the extracts by pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total soluble sugars (TS) and chromatographic profiles were analyzed. Germination tests were carried out in quadruplicate with 50 seeds to with gearbox, in according to RAS recommendations. For each treatment, it was calculated the germination percentage (\% G), the germination speed index (GSI), the percentage of the first germination count (PCG\%), the mean germination time (MGT), and the length of the aerial part (CPA), roots (CR) and the embryonic axis (EEC) lettuce seedlings. We used the Scott-Knott mean test at 5\% probability and the design was completely randomized. The pH, EC and AST parameters in extracts showed normal. It could be observed with the chromatographic profiles, the existence and variability in relation to the concentrations and types of flavonoids in treatments. There was a statistical difference among the means of the \%PCG, \%G, IVG and TMG. The lowest percentages of PCG were obtained with aqueous extracts of vetiver root in the three concentrations, for both techniques, and the aqueous extract of the root of paspalum 1\% maceration. The lower \%G and IVG was obtained with the aqueous extract of 1\% vetiver root, followed by concentrations of 3 and 5\% and the aqueous extract paspalum root of 1\%, all by maceration. There was also a statistical difference among the average of the CPA, CR and CEE. The aqueous extracts of vetiver grass and paspalum grass revealed allelopathic potential showing different responses (inhibition or promotion).},

Our results showed that PFW and PPG improve composting mechanisms, accelerate organic substance degradation, and increase fertilizing elements (P2O5, K2O, MgO, CaO). The low level of C/N ratio in the finished composts reflects the good quality of the prepared composts. The effect of PFW and PPG additives on plant growth was evaluated using chickpea plants. Addition of PFW and PPG enhanced significantly chickpea plant growth and development, compared to the control, especially when added simultaneously. These results indicate that PFW and PPG can be utilized in compost formulations, and as fertilizers in agricultural practices to improve chickpea plant growth and development, while at the same time reducing the environmental and health risks associated with their disposal.},

	abstract = {Organic farming is gaining interest worldwide due to its low environmental impact. However, questions still remain about its long-term sustainability, particularly in terms of nutrient management. There is debate about the ability of organic farming systems to compensate for nutrient exports due to crop and animal production. Stockless systems are considered as the most critical and they are generally associated with negative farm-gate nutrient budgets. In this study, we examined the farm-gate nutrient budgets of 23 organic farms located in southwestern France, with special focus on stockless farming systems. Phosphorus (P) was taken as a case study due to the issue of its critical management in organic farming systems. The farms were characterised on the basis of interviews with farmers and the soil nutrient status was assessed through soil sampling. Results showed that none of the farms imported rock phosphate fertiliser. On the contrary, most farms imported organic fertiliser and/or compost and manure, the latter from neighbouring farms or urban areas. As a consequence, stockless farm P budgets were not necessarily negative and options existed from achieving better nutrient cycle closure. However, soil P test was low to moderate in many cases. These results suggested that P management in organic farming systems is not simply related to the mixed versus specialised characteristics of the farms and that nutrient cycling should be addressed and assessed at a larger, e.g., district, scale.},

	abstract = {Este trabalho mostrou pela primeira vez que técnicas de transformação de nutrientes orgânicos baseados em materiais disponíveis localmente (esterco, resíduos verdes e biochar avançado) podem aumentar a eficiência de fertilização do substrato resultante por um fator de três em comparação com outras emendas orgânicas sem biocarvão. Utilizamos três métodos diferentes de compostagem para investigar as técnicas de transformação de nutrientes orgânicos; i) compostagem convencional (processo de compostagem concluído sem virar as pilhas) ii) compostagem aeróbica (processo de compostagem com rotação manual de pilhas) e iii) compostagem bokashi (fermentação anaeróbica por lacto). A compostagem foi realizada na ausência (composto somente) e na presença de biochar (co-composto). O biocarvão foi produzido localmente a partir de um arbusto invasor ' Eupatorium adenophorum' Um ensaio em vaso com milho cultivado em solo argiloso foi realizado para investigar o efeito agronômico produzido usando três métodos de compostagem mencionados acima, que foram comparados com fertilizantes minerais convencionais (NPK). Efeitos significativos do bokashi-biochar co-composto (60 t ha- 1 ) foram observados no crescimento do milho, que aumentou a biomassa em 243\% em comparação com a NPK mineral, mostrando também melhores efeitos de crescimento do que as emendas de composições aeróbicas e convencionais. Os nutrientes disponíveis no solo melhorados (P disponível e outros cátions base trocáveis ​​(K + , Ca 2+ e Mg 2+ )) foram provavelmente a causa do efeito de crescimento superior do bokashi-biochar co-composto.},

This study extends previous findings by demonstrating that external capital availability and internal slack can either provide the financial support for family firms to remain committed to socioemotional wealth or to motivate those firms to engage in foreign expansion. The results from a sample of 640 firms based in 19 different countries during the period of 2008 to 2012 suggest that there is less probability of family firms expanding into foreign countries when the home country’s capital availability is high, when the host country’s capital availability is low, or when the internal financial slack is high. The research also explores interactions between external capital availability and internal financial slack. The theoretical model and empirical tests contribute to understanding of family firms’ internationalization, and they provide a strong catalyst for future research on family firms.},

Through qualitative interviews with women who started their own business during the financial crisis, it investigates how the allocation of resources and opportunities built on care enabled women to start and sustain their own business and achieve a degree of normative conformity, creating social cohesion in the here and now. The analysis reveals the transformational potential of familial care by illustrating three modes of resources of care that contribute to business viability, and positions the family, an organizing principle, in the centre of research on gendered mobilizations in crisis economies. In that way, the study critically contributes to debates regarding gender, entrepreneurship and austerity.},

(2013) to clarify the relationship between entrepreneurial readiness and entrepreneurial behaviours across countries and determine whether formal institutions moderate this relationship.,This paper uses data collected by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, the Index of Economic Freedom, Political Risk Services, and the Freedom House and Political Constraint Index to test a theoretical model. A multilevel analysis is performed based on set of 377,356 observations from 51 countries spanning eight years (2001-2008).,The results suggest that entrepreneurial readiness has a strong relationship with entrepreneurial behaviour (as measured by entrepreneurial entry and opportunity-based entrepreneurship) and that this relationship strengthens with increases in political democracy (PD), government regulations (GR), financial capital availability (FCA) and market liquidity (ML).,The study is based on Holmes et al.’s (2013) institutions that are most important for society, uses satisfactory sample size and multi-level modelling. However, many more institutional conditions that remain to be considered might affect entrepreneurial activities.,For policy-makers, the results show that PD, GR, FCA and ML correlate favourably with entrepreneurial behaviour when individuals have a high level of entrepreneurial readiness. Policy-makers should introduce policies that provide a secure environment to individuals to start their own ventures.,The current study is among the first to examine the three dimensions of formal institutions—political, regulatory, and economic institutions—in a single study. Using the three dimensions, the study explains theoretically and examines empirically the effect of individual-level entrepreneurial readiness on entrepreneurial behaviour.},

However, prior empirical research has neglected potential contingencies that determine whether family firms’ need for control affects their equity financing decisions. The purpose of this paper is to provide first insight into this research void.,The paper builds on rational choice theory and a logit regression using secondary data.,The study shows that the effect of family firm owners’ need for control on their consideration of external equity depends on the extent to which owners expect investors to interfere with management and the extent to which decision making is affected by emotions. Hereby, the present study provides evidence that family firm owners’ decisions to use external equity are more complex than previously presumed.,This study has several limitations that provide fruitful avenues for further research. Overall, the authors list and detail seven different limitations in the paper, e.g. the narrow focus on equity financing, the use of a partial model, the fact that the authors did not conceptualize differences between different types of investors (such as high net worth individuals, private equity firms and venture capital firms) in the model and further more.,The study shows that investors need to understand the complex interplay among family firms’ need for control, expected investor interference and emotional decision making, to correctly assess their chances of success when approaching family firms for equity.,Prior empirical research has neglected potential contingencies that determine whether family firms’ need for control affects their equity financing decisions.

	abstract = {The role of values and motivations in understanding the entrepreneurial cognitive process deserves closer attention. So far, the predominant approach has been studying the entrepreneurial intention. This has been a very fruitful avenue of research. However, there is still much to be known to fully understand how the decision to start a venture is formed, and how the individual acts to implement that decision. Values and motivations are closely related, since both of them are linked to the notion of goals. The higher the importance attached to a goal, the more likely the person will form action plans to achieve it. In this paper, we present some ideas on how values and motivations could be integrated into the predominant entrepreneurial intention model. Firstly, we propose that values may help to explain the formation of intention antecedents (e.g., attitudes), and also moderate their effect on the entrepreneurial intention. Secondly, we point to the possibility that values and motivations may also play a role in the intention–action link. In particular, they may be instrumental in overcoming the barriers and obstacles toward effective start-up. In addition, this paper is also an introduction to the special issue, and we present the four papers selected to be included and highlight some of the most interesting aspects of their contributions.},

	abstract = {The role of values and motivations in understanding the entrepreneurial cognitive process deserves closer attention. So far, the predominant approach has been studying the entrepreneurial intention. This has been a very fruitful avenue of research. However, there is still much to be known to fully understand how the decision to start a venture is formed, and how the individual acts to implement that decision. Values and motivations are closely related, since both of them are linked to the notion of goals. The higher the importance attached to a goal, the more likely the person will form action plans to achieve it. In this paper, we present some ideas on how values and motivations could be integrated into the predominant entrepreneurial intention model. Firstly, we propose that values may help to explain the formation of intention antecedents (e.g., attitudes), and also moderate their effect on the entrepreneurial intention. Secondly, we point to the possibility that values and motivations may also play a role in the intention–action link. In particular, they may be instrumental in overcoming the barriers and obstacles toward effective start-up. In addition, this paper is also an introduction to the special issue, and we present the four papers selected to be included and highlight some of the most interesting aspects of their contributions.},

	abstract = {Why are intentions interesting to those who care about new venture formation? Entrepreneurship is a way of thinking, a way of thinking that emphasizes opportunities over threats. The opportunity identification process is clearly an intentional process, and, therefore, entrepreneurial intentions clearly merit our attention. Equally important, they offer a means to better explain—and predict—entrepreneurship. We don't start a business as a reflex, do we? We may respond to the conditions around us, such as an intriguing market niche, by starting a new venture. Yet, we think about it first; we process the cues from the environment around us and set about constructing the perceived opportunity into a viable business proposition. In the psychological literature, intentions have proven the best predictor of planned behavior, particularly when that behavior is rare, hard to observe, or involves unpredictable time lags. New businesses emerge over time and involve considerable planning. Thus, entrepreneurship is exactly the type of planned behavior Bird 1988, Katz and Gartner 1988 for which intention models are ideally suited. If intention models prove useful in understanding business venture formation intentions, they offer a coherent, parsimonious, highly-generalizable, and robust theoretical framework for understanding and prediction. Empirically, we have learned that situational (for example, employment status or informational cues) or individual (for example, demographic characteristics or personality traits) variables are poor predictors. That is, predicting entrepreneurial activities by modeling only situational or personal factors usually resulted in disappointingly small explanatory power and even smaller predictive validity. Intentions models offer us a significant opportunity to increase our ability to understand and predict entrepreneurial activity. The current study compares two intention-based models in terms of their ability to predict entrepreneurial intentions: Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB) and Shapero's model of the entrepreneurial event (SEE). Ajzen argues that intentions in general depend on perceptions of personal attractiveness, social norms, and feasibility. Shapero argues that entrepreneurial intentions depend on perceptions of personal desirability, feasibility, and propensity to act. We employed a competing models approach, comparing regression analyses results for the two models. We tested for overall statistical fit and how well the results supported each component of the models. The sample consisted of student subjects facing imminent career decisions. Results offered strong statistical support for both models. (1) Intentions are the single best predictor of any planned behavior, including entrepreneurship. Understanding the antecedents of intentions increases our understanding of the intended behavior. Attitudes influence behavior by their impact on intentions. Intentions and attitudes depend on the situation and person. Accordingly, intentions models will predict behavior better than either individual (for example, personality) or situational (for example, employment status) variables. Predictive power is critical to better post hoc explanations of entrepreneurial behavior; intentions models provide superior predictive validity. (2) Personal and situational variables typically have an indirect influence on entrepreneurship through influencing key attitudes and general motivation to act. For instance, role models will affect entrepreneurial intentions only if they change attitudes and beliefs such as perceived self-efficacy. Intention-based models describe how exogenous influences (for eample, perceptions of resource availability) change intentions and, ultimately, venture creation. (3) The versatility and robustness of intention models support the broader use of comprehensive, theory-driven, testable process models in entrepreneurship research (MacMillan and Katz 1992). Intentional behavior helps explain and model why many entrepreneurs decide to start a business long before they scan for opportunities. Understanding intentions helps researchers and theoreticians to understand related phenomena. These include: what triggers opportunity scanning, the sources of ideas for a business venture, and how the venture ultimately becomes a reality. Intention models can describe how entrepreneurial training molds intentions in subsequent venture creation (for example, how does training in business plan writing change attitudes and intentions?). Past research has extensively explored aspects of new venture plans once written. Intentionality argues instead that we study the planning process itself for determinants of venturing behavior. We can apply intentions models to other strategic decisions such as the decision to grow or exit a business. Researchers can model the intentions of critical stakeholders in the venture, such as venture capitalists' intentions toward investing in a given company. Finally, management researchers can explore the overlaps between venture formation intentions and venture opportunity identification. Entrepreneurs themselves (and those who teach and train them) should benefit from a better understanding of their own motives. The lens provided by intentions affords them the opportunity to understand why they made certain choices in their vision of the new venture. Intentions-based models provide practical insight to any planned behavior. This allows us to better encourage the identification of personally-viable, personally-credible opportunities. Teachers, consultants, advisors, and entrepreneurs should benefit from a better general understanding of how intentions are formed, as well as a specific understanding of how founders' beliefs, perceptions, and motives coalesce into the intent to start a business. This understanding offers sizable diagnostic power, thus entrepreneurship educators can use this model to better understand the motivations and intentions of students and trainees and to help students and trainees understand their own motivations and intentions. Carefully targeted training becomes possible. For example, ethnic and gender differences in career choice are largely explained by self-efficacy differences. Applied work in psychology and sociology tells us that we already know how to remediate self-efficacy differences. Raising entrepreneurial efficacies will raise perceptions of venture feasibility, thus increasing the perception of opportunity. Economic and community development hinges not on chasing smokestacks, but on growing new businesses. To encourage economic development in the form of new enterprises we must first increase perceptions of feasibility and desirability. Policy initiatives will increase business formations if those initiatives positively influence attitudes and thus influence intentions. The growing trends of downsizing and outsourcing make this more than a sterile academic exercise. Even if we successfully increase the quantity and quality of potential entrepreneurs, we must also promote such perceptions among critical stakeholders including suppliers, financiers, neighbors, government officials, and the larger community. The findings of this study argue that promoting entrepreneurial intentions by promoting public perceptions of feasibility and desirability is not just desirable; promoting entrepreneurial intentions is also thoroughly feasible.},

Numerous attitudes have been assessed over the years and, as new social issues emerge, additional attitudinal domains are explored. The chapter provides little evidence to support the postulated existence of stable, underlying attitudes within the individual, which influence both verbal expressions and actions. It examines the relation between two or more actions that were assumed to reflect the same underlying disposition.

This is especially important in peripheral regions that are characterized by low innovative dynamism. This paper analyses the entrepreneurial process in a European peripheral region, the Canary Islands, Spain. It attempts to determine possible cultural specificities and the role of motivation in the entrepreneurial process. To do this, an analysis of entrepreneurial intention (EI) is framed within the theory of planned behaviour and using motivation, opportunity and ability theory. An empirical study was carried out using a sample of 1457 university students participating in the Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students' Survey project. Results indicate that motivation influences EI directly and indirectly through an individual's attitude towards entrepreneurial behaviour. The perception of business opportunities is also a significant antecedent of entrepreneurial motivation. Consequently, entrepreneurial education and policies to foster entrepreneurship in peripheral regions should not attempt to transform individuals' attitudes towards entrepreneurship directly, but rather focus on improving motivation using intensive pedagogical strategies in creativity that go beyond mere informative content. Methodologies and content focused on recognizing opportunities and problem-solving would also be effective elements in educational programmes of entrepreneurship.},

	abstract = {Previous research on the psychology of entrepreneurs found that personality traits such as locus of control failed to distinguish entrepreneurs from managers. In search of an individual characteristic that is distinctively entrepreneurial, we proposed an entrepreneurial self-efficacy construct (ESE) to predict the likelihood of an individual being an entrepreneur. ESE refers to the strength of a person’s belief that he or she is capable of successfully performing the various roles and tasks of entrepreneurship. It consists of five factors: marketing, innovation, management, risk-taking, and financial control. We conducted two studies, one on students and the other on small business executives. Study 1 found that the total ESE score differentiated entrepreneurship students from students of both management and organizational psychology, and that across the three types of students, ESE was positively related to the intention to set up one’s own business. We also found the entrepreneurship students to have higher self-efficacy in marketing, management, and financial control than the management and psychology students. In study 2, we simultaneously tested effects of ESE and locus of control on the criteria of founders vs. nonfounders of current businesses. After controlling for individual and company background variables, the effect of ESE scores was significant, but the effect of locus of control was not. More specifically, it was found that business founders had higher self-efficacy in innovation and risk-taking than did nonfounders. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of entrepreneurial self-efficacy as a distinct characteristic of the entrepreneur. From these results, some important implications can be drawn on entrepreneurial assessment, education, counseling, and community intervention. First, ESE can be used to identify reasons for entrepreneurial avoidance. There may be many individuals who shun entrepreneurial activities not because they actually lack necessary skills but because they believe they do. This is especially true for sectors of the population such as women or those minority groups who are perceived as lacking entrepreneurial traditions. Communities and individuals could benefit from identifying sources of entrepreneurial avoidance by targeting their efforts toward enhancing ESE of particular groups or individuals for specific aspects of entrepreneurship. An additional use of ESE is to identify areas of strength and weakness to assess the entrepreneurial potential of both an individual and a community. Once entrepreneurial potential is identified, resources can be channeled and more effectively used to promote entrepreneurship. Finally, diagnosis and treatment of ESE can be performed on real entrepreneurs. The entrepreneur may be completely avoiding, or performing less frequently, certain critical entrepreneurial activities because s/he lacks self-efficacy. For example, the entrepreneur may be avoiding company growth for fear of losing control. Identification and removal of self-doubt will enable the entrepreneur to be actively engaged in entrepreneurial tasks, more persistent in the face of difficulty and setbacks, and more confident in meeting challenges. Overall, ESE is a moderately stable belief and requires systematic and continuous efforts to be changed. Two broad approaches can be taken toward desired change. One is the micro-approach that directly focuses on people’s beliefs. In designing and conducting entrepreneurship courses, training institutions should not just train students in critical entrepreneurial skills and capabilities but also strengthen their entrepreneurial self-efficacy. The current state of entrepreneurship courses in most management schools may fall short in both respects. Courses focus on commonly identified management skills, but often ignore entrepreneurial skills such as innovation and risk-taking. Furthermore, the teaching of entrepreneurial skills tends to be technical, with insufficient attention paid to the cognition and belief systems of the entrepreneur. Educators should take into account entrepreneurial attitudes and perceptions when designing or assessing their course objectives. Conscious efforts could be made to enhance ESE by involving the students in “real-life” business design or community small business assistance, by inviting successful entrepreneurs to lecture, and by verbal persuasion from the instructor and renowned entrepreneurs. The second approach to enhancing ESE is to work on the environment of potential and actual entrepreneurs. According to the reciprocal causation model, the environment may affect self-efficacy not only directly but also indirectly through performance. An environment perceived to be more supportive will increase entrepreneurial self-efficacy because individuals assess their entrepreneurial capacities in reference to perceived resources, opportunities, and obstacles existing in the environment. Personal efficacy is more likely to be developed and sustained in a supportive environment than in an adverse one. A supportive environment is also more likely to breed entrepreneurial success, which in turn further enhances entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Communities can work toward creating an efficacy enhancing environment by making resources both available and visible, publicizing entrepreneurial successes, increasing the diversity of opportunities, and avoiding policies that create real or perceived obstacles.},

To provide information on the scale of informal irrigation systems in Colombia, their type, the users they serve, and the type of water sources they use, a large-scale partial inventory was made combining statistical analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and field trips. The findings indicate that informal irrigation is widespread in the country's mountainous zones, in a great diversity of environments, characterized by an equally great diversity of local uses and water-use strategies.

	abstract = {The article discusses the challenges and prospects of implementing the Water Framework Directive (WFD), one of the most comprehensive pieces of environmental legislationpassed by the European Union (EU). The translation of the WFD into policy-making is analysed through a case study - which combined interviews, participant observation and the attendance of public events - in the Portuguese section of the Douro River Basin. The evolution of water regulation is initially considered according to a suggested classification into five phases of water management. The examination then addresses the main aspects of the WFD experience in the Douro, exploring elements of innovation and continuity. Higher concern for environmental conservation and the detailed assessment of water management problems are significant improvements that followed the introduction of the WFD. However, the same institutional reforms have also served to consolidate techno-bureaucratic approaches centred on the economic values of water. As a result, the rationality and failures of the new water regulation prompted unexpected opposition from various stakeholder groups, such as farmers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and urban water customers. The success of the WFD is directly dependent on the ability to perceive the politicised complexity of water management and on effective mechanisms of dialogue and social inclusion. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Currently, in the prevention, maintenance, or remediation of river crossings, traditional engineering techniques are generally applied, which often leads to insufficient solutions concerning technical, financial, and environmental issues. The soil bioengineering methods, using vegetation in combination with inert materials for soil stabilization and protection against erosion, can be an alternative, a complementary tool, or even a substitute for traditional engineering practice. In this context, this work aims to present one case study of an exposed pipeline in which were used some soil bioengineering approaches to prevent natural erosion processes at pipeline river crossings. Compared to conventional methods, the soil bioengineering techniques used in the presented case study have proved to be advantageous in economic, environmental, and aesthetic aspects.},

	abstract = {The extensive use of chemical fertilizers poses serious collateral problems such as environmental pollution, pest resistance development and food safety decline. Researches focused on applying plant-beneficial microorganisms to partially replace chemical fertilizer use is increasing due to the requirement of sustainable agriculture development. Thus to investigate the possibility of a plant-beneficial Trichoderma strain and its bio-organic fertilizer product in saving chemical fertilizer application and in improving crop quality, a field trial and continuous pot experiments were carried out with tomato. Four treatments were set up: a reduced application of chemical fertilizer (75\% of the conventional application) plus Trichoderma-enriched bio-organic fertilizer (BF), organic fertilizer (OF) or Trichoderma spore suspension (SS), with using the 100\% rate of the conventional chemical fertilizer as the control (CF). The results showed that the total soluble sugar, Vitamin C and nitrate accumulations were, respectively, +up to 24\%, +up to 57\% and –up to 62\% in the tomatoes of the BF treatment compared to those of the control (CF). And both of the pot and field trials revealed that reduced rates of chemical fertilizer plus bio-organic fertilizer produced tomato yields equivalent to those obtained using the 100\% of the chemical fertilizer. However, application with the inoculant alone (SS) or combined with the organic fertilizer alone (OF) would lead to a yield decreases of 6–38\% and 9–35\% over the control. Since the increased abundance of soil microflora and the enhanced soil fertility frequently showed positive linear correlations especially in the BF-treated soils, we conclude that the efficacy of this bio-organic fertilizer for maintaining a stable tomato yield and improving tomato quality may be due to the improved soil microbial activity. Thus, the results suggest that the Trichoderma bio-organic fertilizer could be employed in combination with the appropriate rates of chemical fertilizers to get maximum benefits regarding yield, quality and fertilizer savings.},

	abstract = {Smartphone technology is promising for the future development of agriculture, as it can facilitate and improve many operational procedures and can also be combined with precision agriculture technologies. Yet, existing research on smartphone adoption in agriculture is scarce. Therefore, this paper empirically explores the factors influencing smartphone adoption by German farmers. The relationship between farmers, farm characteristics and smartphone adoption was analysed using a binomial logit model. The dataset, collected in 2016, consists of 817 German farmers and is representative in terms of age, farm size and diversification as well as regional distribution across the study area. The results indicate that, among other factors, farmers’ age, education, and farm size are determinants of smartphone adoption. Furthermore, the paper provides descriptive information about the usage of smartphone functions and agriculture-related app functions. Thus, this paper contributes to the literature by identifying key determinants of smartphone adoption in agriculture. The findings may be of interest for policy makers, researchers in the field of precision agriculture technologies as well as developers and providers of farm equipment and precision agriculture technologies that integrate with smartphones, since the paper includes information concerning smartphone use and key factors influencing smartphone adoption.},

The Liberty cv. is the first lowland-type bioenergy switchgrass adapted to USDA hardiness zones 4, 5, and 6. On a medium soil test P clay loam soil, biomass yield response to applied P was linear, increasing 135 kg ha−1 for every kilogram of P applied prior to establishment. Average post-frost biomass yield was 9.6 Mg ha−1 year−1 when unfertilized, and maximum biomass yield was 10.3 Mg ha−1 year−1 when fertilized at 58.6 kg ha−1 P, suggesting that P application on medium soil test P soils is beneficial for switchgrass establishment and early growth. Switchgrass cv. Shawnee was more productive than cvs. Liberty or Sunburst (11.3, 10.2, and 8.6 Mg ha−1 year−1, respectively). Both bacterial and fungal communities were significantly shaped by cultivar. These shifts, while inconsistent between year and cultivar, may reflect a selection of the microbial community from that present in soil to maximize total nutrient uptake, regardless of additional P amendments. Phosphorus fertilization did not affect microbial community structure. Results of this study suggest that the cultivar-associated selection of particular microbial taxa may have implications for increased productivity.},

Digital behavioural change interventions have the potential to provide education and motivate users to regularly engage with self-management of diabetes. This paper describes the development of My Care Hub mobile phone application (app) aimed at supporting self-management in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The development of My Care Hub involved a comprehensive process of healthy behavioural change identification, end users’ needs, expert consensus, data security and privacy considerations. The app translation was a highly iterative process accompanied by usability testing and design modification. The app development process included: (1) behaviour change strategy selection; (2) users’ involvement; (3) expert advisory involvement; (4) data security and privacy considerations; (5) design creation and output translation into a smartphone app and (6) two usability testings of the app prototype version....},

	abstract = {Há alguns anos o agronegócio tem se mostrado um dos setores mais importantes da economia brasileira, não só pela renda gerada, mas também pela geração de empregos; entretanto, os empregos gerados requerem profissionais qualificados e com novas habilidades, uma vez que as empresas de agronegócio atuam em um mercado global e competitivo. A necessidade de formar profissionais com um perfil sintonizado com as demandas sociais do campo vem sendo apontada como um dos principais desafios a serem enfrentados pelas universidades brasileiras, neste princípio de século. Há uma necessidade imediata de reformulação na estrutura de profissional em ciências agrárias, no sentido de um sólido conhecimento teórico-prático não apenas ao “como produzir”, mas também quanto ao processo produtivo como um todo, abrangendo desde o planejamento até a comercialização. A adequação pelas instituições de ensino vai além da preparação de uma grade curricular, ou de inclusão de disciplinas, é necessária uma visão sistêmica e um comprometimento de todos. Sairão à frente as instituições que melhor se adequarem a esta nova realidade. Entretanto, os alunos, também, precisam refletir melhor quanto à sua empregabilidade, se estão atentos às oportunidades que as instituições de ensino oferecem e se o mercado permite que busquem a tão almejada experiência e profissionalismos apenas após a conclusão do curso.Palavras-chave: Ciências Agrárias.

	abstract = {This research is part of the project “Mulheres Conquistando Autonomia" which seeks 
to strengthen the women’s autonomy, contributing to the increase of their insertion and 
permanence in the labor camp. Entrepreneurship is mainly exercised by men. 
However, in recent years there has been a significant increase in female entrepreneurs 
in Brazil and in the world. In addition, women are increasingly filling this space, 
because they have the inner characteristics of entrepreneurship, which shows an 
advantage to undertake. In the Rio Grande do Norte state, the participation of women 
in the business sector has been growing significantly and they are already the majority 
in the main areas of micro individual entrepreneurship. The objective of this work is to 
analyze a structural model that evidences the interrelationship of the key factors that 
influences the intention of the women to undertake. The methodology consisted of 
three fundamental moments. Initially, a search in the databases was first performed in 
order to obtain a pre-existing theoretical model related to the study theme, then was 
made a survey with entrepreneur women of Rio Grande do Norte to gather data with 
the purpose of understanding the relevance of the variables defined by the theoretical 
construction, and in the end was used the modeling of structural equations to detect 
the constructs that contribute to the investigated process. As a result, it was obtained 
that the “personal attitude”, “individual skills”, and “psychological characteristics” 
influences directly and indirectly in the intention of the women to undertake. On the 
other hand, the “difficulties” built in the labor market did not reach the level of 
significance required in this research, i.e., this variable does not influence women to 
undertake. This structural model used in the research can be the basis for an action 
plan to be expanded by entrepreneurs, so that they hone their skills and improve their 
ability to undertake.},

Differences between exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis, factor retention and factor rotation, adequate sample size, explained variance importance, and factor solution reliability are some of the discussed topics. It is pointed out the fact that all decisions to be taken during the implementation of an exploratory factor analysis cannot be arbitrary and subjective, but must be based on clear theoretical and methodological criteria.

This study focuses on a systematic evaluation and separation of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) induced droughts and irrigation water withdrawal impacts on flow levels using a novel and powerful statistical technique, called JRFit. JRFit procedure was applied to quantify significant differences in streamflows, baseflows, and low flow statistics during non-irrigation (NI) and irrigation (IR) periods associated with ENSO phases. The results indicate that overall streamflow levels have decreased by approximately 20\% after the introduction of irrigation in the study area. Lowering of flow levels mainly occur during La Niña phases which gets exacerbated (decreased by 50\%) during growing season of IR compared to NI periods. Flow duration curve analysis showed that the frequency of low flows has increased during IR period impairing aquatic ecosystem. This is the first time an elimination approach is used to separate and quantify the impacts of anthropogenic and climate signals on water resources. This approach avoids the need of using complex and data intensive groundwater/surface water models in studying climate-stream-aquifer interactions which can be replicated easily in other data scarce watersheds. This study provides useful information to policymakers to devise irrigation water withdrawal policies during La Niña growing seasons for maintaining flow levels in the study area.},

Study focus
This paper presents a component-based integrated environmental model developed through participatory processes to explore sustainable water management options. Possible futures with improved farm profitability and ecological outcomes relative to modelled baselines were identified through exploratory modelling. The integrated model and the results produced are intended to raise awareness and facilitate discussion with and amongst stakeholders.
New hydrological insights
The modelling illustrates that improved farm level knowledge and management with regard to crop water requirements, soil water capacity, and irrigations are the most significant factors towards achieving outcomes that are robust to a range of climate and water policy futures. Assuming farmer management with regard to these factors are at their most optimal, increasing irrigation efficiency alone did not lead to improved farm profitability and ecological outcomes under drier climate conditions. Likelihood of achieving robust outcomes were further improved through the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, with increased consideration of groundwater use a key factor. Further discussion on the viability and impact of increased groundwater use and conjunctive use policies should be further considered.},

	abstract = {The southeast coastline of the Barents Sea in the area of the Varandey settlement is characterized by warm permafrost. Coastal studies conducted since the early 1980s have shown coastal retreat with average erosion rates of up to 2–5 m/yr from 1969 to 1987 at different locations in the area. The present study summarizes long-term (1951–2013) observations of environmental forcing in the area, and estimations of retreat rates based on recent fieldwork (2011–2013) and remote sensing studies (1961–2012). Such data is of primary importance for any infrastructure developments in the study area. The coastline was divided into three conditional geographical sectors: Pesyakov, Varandey, and Medynskiy. It was found that the average erosion rate in eroding parts of Pesyakov sector was 2 m/yr, in the western part of Varandey sector—1.8 m/yr, and in the entire Medynskiy sector—2.3 m/yr over the last 54 years. Remote sensing observations documented the destruction of numerous buildings in the coastal zone of the Novyy Varandey settlement in 2004–2012. A striking coastal bluff recession of 19.6 m/yr over the 15-km-long coastline in Medynskiy was observed between 2010 and 2011, following a storm surge in the area in the summer of 2010. Fluctuations of environmental forcing (air temperatures, wave energy factor, significant wave height, and sea level) were observed in the Varandey area in 1979–2013. The long-term evolution of environmental forcing exhibits an increasing trend. The increase (0.6–4.8 m/yr) of average long-term erosion rates in the Medynskiy sector from 1961 to 2013 followed the evolution of environmental forcing in 1979–2013. Different coastal erosion responses and processes varying from a stable situation to active erosion due to mechanical wave action, thermal abrasion, thermal denudation, or a combination of these processes were identified in the Varandey area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, we analyzed the wave data in response to the cold front passages over Louisiana continental shelf. The data examined in this research is mainly from WAVCIS (Wave-Current-surge Information System), Coastal Ocean Estuarine Dynamics Lab at Louisiana State University and Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). With respect to the wave response to the atmospheric forcing, here we consider: (1) the connection between wave variability and atmospheric frontal passages, and (2) the influence on the SST variations during the processes. The occurrences of wind wave, precipitation, and weather processes have distinct regularities. Atmospheric cold fronts have an important influence on wave formation and associated processes over Louisiana continental shelf.},

	abstract = {The destruction of groundwater resources caused by coal mining is the main bottleneck restricting the sustainable development of economy and environment in coal mining area. The contradiction between mining of coal resources and protection of water resources will become more serious. China's coal-rich regions are mainly distributed in north and northwest China. Only coal reserves in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Xinjiang provinces account for 73.1\% of the total coal reserves. Groundwater resources in these coal-rich areas are relatively poor. Severe water shortage accounted for 71\% of key mining areas and 40\% of serious water shortages. The serious damage to underground water resources exacerbated the shortage of water resources in the mining areas, which is particularly prominent in the energy province of Shanxi. The fundamental reason is that the mining caused structural changes in aquifers, resulting in damage to groundwater resources, so that the groundwater resources from the original quality of water available for exploitation into the pit of mine water and drain away, undermine the groundwater fill row, and destroyed the hydrological surface conditions, undermined the surface water cycle, thus affecting the regional groundwater cycle situation. During the coal mining process, the destruction of the surrounding rock caused the change of the aquifer and the aquifer structure, coupled with the large amount of drainage of the mine water, the underground water flow field evolved to the groundwater circulation mode under the coal mining condition. After the mine has been closed, the groundwater flow field and the environment of the mine which has been disturbed by mining are changed again. The original aquifer and the mining disturbance fissure space is flooded again, the water chemistry environment also changes obviously at the same time, forms the new pattern of the groundwater environment circulation evolution after the coal mining. The evolution of groundwater cycle pattern during coal mining and coal mining has four-dimensional dynamic evolution, nonlinearity and complexity. In the past, most researches have been carried out from the perspective of hydraulic conductivity and mining water-inrush mechanism of single coalmine mining, and the influence mechanism of dynamic evolution of mining fissures on the structural variation of aquifers. However, this is the key to reveal the redistribution rules of groundwater resources caused by coal mining and to clarify the true pattern of regional groundwater cycle evolution under coal mining conditions. Under the coal mining condition, the groundwater resources are destroyed and the groundwater environment is deteriorated. It is revealed that the real law of regional water cycle evolution after coal mining is the key issues to realize the regulation and optimization of water resources, and to realize the economic and resources and environmental development. Based on the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, this paper studies the influence of aquifer structure variation on the regional groundwater cycle mechanism in the mining area of Lu'an, Changzhi basin, Shanxi, and reveals the variation of regional aquifer spatial structure after coal mining, to identify the true state of redistribution of groundwater resources during coal mining, to further develop a new theory of groundwater system evolution under the variation of aquifer spatial structure, and to enrich regional water cycle research under changing environment; The characteristics of underground water circulation evolution and redistribution of groundwater resources, to a certain extent to achieve the aquifer spatial structure variation on the groundwater cycle evolution mechanism of the characteristics of innovation and theoretical breakthroughs, this study is not only of practical significance for coal mining area economy, resources and the environment can be the sustainable development, and it has theoretical value for the study of groundwater cycle evolution under the condition of group mining. It provides reference for the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources and the planning and design of water conservation for coal mining. 1 Main research contents (1) The influence of spatial and temporal evolution of mining fissures on the structural variation of regional aquifers. Through the research on the characteristics of time-space distribution and dynamic evolution of overburden deformation, failure and mining fissure in typical mining area, the change of buried depth, thickness and boundary condition of water-bearing medium, the porosity and fracture rate The characteristics of heterogeneity of water medium in the influence range of coal mining are expounded. Through the study of the mechanism of mutual conversion between water-bearing medium and water-conducting property, the results of coal seam mining-induced and the variation model of aquifer structure in mining area affected by coal mining is established. (2) Effect of aquifer structure variation on regional water cycle driven by group mining. Based on the in-depth study on the heterogeneous evolution characteristics and evolution trend of the regional aquifer caused by coal mining in the group, the latest information, data and data of the groundwater in the area after coal mining are obtained, and the regional groundwater flow pattern the evolution of hydrogeological structure and the coupling of groundwater flow patterns under the influence of coal mining in coal mines, and the influence mechanism of heterogeneous evolution of aquifer spatial structure on regional water cycle, and the establishment of regional groundwater circulation evolution model. (3) The evolution trend and redistribution of groundwater resources driven by coal mining. Based on the research results of groundwater cycle evolution under the driving of coal mining, the evolution trend and redistribution of groundwater resources during coal mining and coal mining are carried out. The evaluation model of water resources under mining conditions is established, and comprehensive evaluation of basin water resources, revealing the status, characteristics, changing regularity and availability of redistributed groundwater resources after coal seam mining. 2 The main research results (1) A structural variation model of aquifer influenced by coal mining in typical mining area was established on FLAC3D, based on the study of mechanism of water-retaining and water-conducting mutual transformation of water-bearing medium, revealing the variation law of aquifer structure caused by coal mining. The results show that the development law of the hydraulic fractured zone above the mined-out area is slightly saddle-shaped with the height of 105.7 m on both sides and the middle height of 97.5 m on both sides. The simulation results are in good agreement with the measured data, which can effectively predict the spatial structure of the aquifer after coal mining. (2) Based on the statistical analysis of stratigraphic lithology data of geological boreholes, TPROGS is used to establish the Markov transition probabilistic geostatistical model for the simulation of water-bearing media, revealing the heterogeneous evolution and trend of the aquifer spatial structure in the study area. The results show that there is a linear relationship between the thickness of the coal seams and the height of the variation zone of the permeability coefficient. The bigger the thickness is, the bigger the variation of the permeability coefficient is. The model can accurately predict the permeability coefficient of rock K, the calculation accuracy is much higher than the previous empirical formula. (3) According to the controlling factors of water-bearing strata and coal seams, the numerical simulation model of variable-parameter groundwater system is established based on the control factors of aquifer structure variation such as water-conducting fissure, surface tension fracture and mining subsidence. The evolution of groundwater flow field under different mining conditions in the study area is predicted by model analysis, and the groundwater cycle pattern and water resources evolution rule driven by coal mining are revealed. The results show that the development of mining fissures in coal seams is basically confined in intact bedrock, which makes the clay strata bent and deformed, and the water level of confined aquifers decreases to form the "upper stagnant water", and the aquifer structure of Quaternary and the effective thickness of the aquitard are thinned. In some areas, the aquifer is cut off because of mining fissures cut through the aquifers, and the man-made "trace-source erosion" caused by coal mining has caused the original isolated groundwater system between the phenomenon of groundwater seized, an appropriate increase in mine water recharge. (4) The trend and redistribution of groundwater resources during coal mining and coal mining. The results show that ground fissures or cracks of different scale appear in the affected area of the mined-out area, and the precipitation infiltration recharge is changed from piston type to shortcut type. At the same time, the original sandstone and shale containment system is destroyed, the groundwater level is decreased and the water supply is increased. The ground subsidence and groundwater increase the groundwater storage Space, changing the characteristics of the fill row, natural base flow reduction into pit water, changing the groundwater system on the role of runoff storage, surface runoff is not only affected by precipitation, groundwater storage control role, but also by the mine drainage effect, making the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources increased. (5) Variation of aquifer structure driven by group mining is the main factor of Changzhi basin groundwater recharge row circulation pattern change. The damage of coal mining to groundwater system is irreversible and the damage degree is increasing. Even if the mine is closed, not mining does not mean not stop the destruction of groundwater resources, damaged groundwater system can not be restored, although not drainage, there is still a large amount of water into the mine go to become contaminated old pit water. 3 The main innovation (1) The aquifer structure variation model established by FLAC3D has good fitting effect with the measured data, which can effectively predict the spatial structure change of the aquifer after coal mining. (2) The Markov transition probabilistic geostatistical model can predict the permeability coefficient K of the rock more accurately than the previous empirical formula. The Markov transition probability geostatistical model can be used to calculate the permeability coefficient of the aquifer in the study area. And provide the basic data for the research of water cycle mechanism. (3) The numerical simulation model of groundwater system with variable parameter structure is established, and the traditional deterministic groundwater model is improved to improve the reliability and accuracy of simulation. Based on the model analysis, the evolution of groundwater flow field under different mining conditions was predicted, and the groundwater cycle pattern and water resources evolution rule driven by coal mining were revealed. The technical basis for rational exploitation, scientific management and environmental protection of groundwater resources was provided. © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Between 1999 and 2007, several successive years of severe drought put South East Queensland's water supply under immense pressure. The decision was taken in 2005 to build a seawater desalination plant and three water recycling advanced treatment plants as part of a large investment plan to secure the region's potable water supply. The infrastructure built and commissioned in the past 3 years has a combined capacity producing more than 350,000 m3 per day of very high quality water that can be used either directly (seawater desalination) or indirectly (recycled water) for supplying drinking water. All the plants primarily rely on reverse osmosis membranes for water purification which is an effective and reliable barrier to contaminants, but also requires high energy consumption and a high level of pre-treatment and chemicals. In this paper, the actual energy consumption of two of the plants (the seawater desalination plant and one water recycling plant) was investigated with the perspective of drinking water production over the July 2009-June 2010 period. Eolia™ Potable Water, a Life Cycle Analysis tool developed by Veolia Environnement Research \&amp; Innovation, was used to model the processes and estimate the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from both plants. As expected, the energy requirement of the desalination was higher (approximately 2.2 times) than the water recycling plant. The plants were found to be significantly more energy efficient when operated at higher flow. In both cases, the purchase of electrical energy represented by far the major contribution to GHG emissions. Indirect GHG emissions from chemical consumption could be reduced at the water recycling plant by optimising the dose of ferric chloride used at the plant and sourcing the chemical from a less distant supplier. © IWA Publishing 2011.},

We examine the challenges confronting adoption of these innovations that revolve around perceptions of fairness and public acceptability. A major obstacle to these approaches' adoption is environmental justice - that the risk and burden of resource solutions, as well as their benefits - should be borne equitably, despite differences of income or race. We first consider how debates regarding water supply are often disputes over different notions of environmental justice. We then examine general equity debates over adopting various innovations in one US state at the nexus of water demand and supply innovation: California. We contend that fairly adopting these innovations requires embracing open, inclusive, and transparent decision-making processes inwhich no important constituency is excluded fromdecisions, and in which different notions of environmental justice are embraced. © IWA Publishing 2011.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to present a new methodological approach to help companies improve their decision-taking capacity regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the context of climate change (CC). Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted by combining a wide variety of sources including articles and research reports. Taking into account the complexity of adapting in a context of climate change, the paper developed a simplified conceptual model that integrates multi-criteria analysis. A vulnerability matrix was generated as a combination of adaptive capacity, exposure and sensitivity and how to measure the magnitude, persistence, uncertainty, temporality, degree of importance in combination with the impacts. Findings: The first results reveal that activities related to water resources or natural ecosystems are more important than those related to energy or tourism sectors, and that there is a relationship between opportunities and adaptation needs. Practical implications: The paper documents the inverse relationship between adaptation measures and opportunities in a study that may be a starting-point for further research into empirical observations of sector vulnerability and the impact and integration of the factor of resilience. Originality/value: The paper provides a common language to use in the business world for concepts related to climate change. It provides a methodological approach for finding solutions to the problem of resource optimisation in companies and helps to find new business opportunities for sectors. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In the last 20 years the focus of environmental policy shifted from economical to biological dimension. The Factor Four concept of von Weizäcker was originally conceived for solving economic issues of overexploited natural resources. Implementation of an array of technological innovations is leading to sustainability, however this is not enough. Now the concept could be applied to ecosystems related issues, like water resources. Services rendered by ecosystems are linked to economic activity of humans. Doubling efforts to "protect" water resources will lead to twofold increase in its "productivity". Proper land management improves water resources, which enhances biodiversity and finally protects environment. Some examples of water resources management in the light of ecohydrology is proposed. The conflict between protection versus use of ecosystems is also discussed. Initiative on the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) is proposed as a possible approach.},

Conceived primarily as a communication tool in the late 1970s to explain societal dependence on nature, it now incorporates economic dimensions and provides help to decision makers for implementing effective conservation policies which support human wellbeing and sustainable development. The founding work appeared in the late 1980s led to the conducting by policymakers of a more systematic assessment of the net monetary value associated with the preservation or restoration of natural areas.

	abstract = {Spatial water resource monitoring systems (SWRMS) can provide valuable information in support of water management, but current operational systems are few and provide only a subset of the information required. Necessary innovations include the explicit description of water redistribution and water use from river and groundwater systems, achieving greater spatial detail (particularly in key features such as irrigated areas and wetlands), and improving accuracy as assessed against hydrometric observations, as well as assimilating those observations. The Australian water resources assessment (AWRA) system aims to achieve this by coupling landscape models with models describing surface water and groundwater dynamics and water use. A review of operational and research applications demonstrates that satellite observations can improve accuracy and spatial detail in hydrological model estimation. All operational systems use dynamic forcing, land cover classifications and a priori parameterisation of vegetation dynamics that are partially or wholly derived from remote sensing. Satellite observations are used to varying degrees in model evaluation and data assimilation. The utility of satellite observations through data assimilation can vary as a function of dominant hydrological processes. Opportunities for improvement are identified, including the development of more accurate and higher spatial and temporal resolution precipitation products, and the use of a greater range of remote sensing products in a priori model parameter estimation, model evaluation and data assimilation. Operational challenges include the continuity of research satellite missions and data services, and the need to find computationally-efficient data assimilation techniques. The successful use of observations critically depends on the availability of detailed information on observational error and understanding of the relationship between remotely-sensed and model variables, as affected by conceptual discrepancies and spatial and temporal scaling. © 2011 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Pressing water scarcity in Jordan rapidly increases the demands of marginal water resources for the agricultural sector. Water management studies reveal that no single source could fully solve the nation's water shortage and many integrated actions are needed to ensure water availability, suitability and sustainability. Yet, among these options treated wastewater has the largest potential to augment water supply in the near future, thereby narrowing the gap between available freshwater and total demand. Indeed, treated wastewater could be a valuable source for irrigation in the agricultural sector and an increasing percentage of irrigated areas, especially in the Jordan Valley, are currently using treated wastewater. With a fast growing population and expansion of the irrigated areas to meet food demand, the pressure on water resources in Jordan remains of imminent importance. Hence, an urgent call to analyze the current and potential role of treated wastewater seems justified. Under the umbrella of the project on the Sustainable Management of Available Water Resources with Innovative Technologies (SMART) funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research in Germany, an investigation has been carried out in the Jordan Valley to estimate the current wastewater reuse quantities and the potential to increase its utility for agricultural production. In general, the reuse as percentage of total treatment is applied for national and international comparisons. Yet, this index is of limited use for policy decisions as it does not reflect potentialities of wastewater use. Therefore, this study introduces a wastewater reuse index (WRI) that reflects the actual proportion of wastewater reused from the total generated wastewater. We found that the WRI in Jordan steadily increased from 30\% in 2004 to 38 in 2007. Efficient use of treated wastewater requires the application of new technologies in Jordan like dwellings connected to the sewer system, decentralization of treatment plants to rural and urban settlements and prevention of high evaporation rates from stabilization ponds. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

A central concern of this paper is to demonstrate that policy regionalism, as a process-based understanding of institutions and decision-making, better explains the causes, forms, and outcomes of hydraulic reach than do more structural approaches. Hermosillo, Mexico presents an unfolding case of rural-urban tension for control over rivers and aquifers as well as the infrastructure for water capture, storage, conveyance, and wastewater release. The analysis employs process documentation of water transfer and wastewater negotiations through interviews, review of primary documents, and field observations. Hermosillo's recourse to negotiated agreements and quasi-market transactions, led by an emerging group of public sector innovators, advances understanding of water policy in Mexico by moving beyond prevailing concerns with the water reform's neoliberal underpinnings to exploration of rapidly changing urban-centered experimentation. We conclude that evolving urban-rural power disparities and water resource landscapes of urban growth will drive continued expansion of hydraulic reach in water-scarce regions globally. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This has been demonstrated by Japan's success in overcoming the energy crises in the 1970s and subsequent high-technology miracle in the 1980s. Similar to Japan's energy security, securing water is crucial for Singapore as approximately a third of the water supply is imported. This study traces the extensive stepwise endeavors Singapore undertook to address this problem. Initial attempts of learning from imported technology lead to the development of indigenous capabilities followed by export acceleration. This in turn has lead to a phenomenon observed and described as co-evolutionary " acclimatization" , which has enabled the nation to successfully substitute 30\% of water demand with technology-driven NEWater. This paper demonstrates the challenges faced in developing and disseminating these leading-edge technologies. The final result is " localizing" knowledge and creating local innovation using the knowledge from leading global firms thereby providing mutual benefits to competitors leading to the co-evolution between innovation and institutional systems. This co-evolutionary process provides new insights into innovation and industry emergence, particularly for inducing the economies at the bottom of the pyramid. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {As the world population increases, more and more people will live and work in cities. Urbanization involves replacement of vegetated surfaces by impervious surfaces; often causing an increase in the rate and volume of surface runoff of rainwater. Climate change may further increase these fluctuations and the flood risk. Beijing experiences rapid urbanization and the rapid urban extension alter natural hydrological processes. Urban green spaces have positive effects on infiltration and storage of water in the soil, resulting in run-off reduction, nutrient and pollutant removal, and improved groundwater quality. Therefore, urban green spaces in Beijing can play an important role in the water cycle, for the improvement of urban ecology and management. Although some studies found that the green areas in Beijing had positive impact on reduction of storm water runoff, only a few studies could reveal the economic or ecological benefits of rainwater storage by urban green spaces. To evaluate the benefits of rainwater storage by urban green spaces and to provide a reference point for the public and government organizations, we grouped rainwater storage into two ecosystem benefits: rainwater runoff reduction and rainwater purification. Based on inventory data of urban green spaces in Beijing (2009), the amount of rainfall runoff reduction was calculated by the rainwater runoff coefficient of different green types, the benefits of rainwater storage by green space were evaluated by the shadow price method of the unit cost for reservoir and price of reclaimed water. The results showed that, a total volume of 1. 54×10 8m 3 rainwater was conserved in these urban green spaces, which almost corresponds to the annual water needs of urban ecological landscape in Beijing, and 2494 m 3 of potential runoff was stored per hectare of green area. The total economic benefit was 1. 34 billion Yuan, which equals three quarters of the maintenance cost of green spaces in Beijing, and the monetary value of runoff storage was 21. 77 thousand Yuan per hectare. We also found that the benefits could be ranked by district or county in the same way as urban green areas, but the average benefits per hectare green spaces showed variable trends, which may be related to the varying ISI (Impervious Surface Index) with regions. To reduce the high runoff during rainfall and increase rainwater harvesting as an alternative water supply one constructs drainage facilities. This implies a greater financial burden and less water resources. Beijing could benefit from improved rainwater drainage through soft ground since the alternative of building and maintaining a storm water drainage system involves a high cost. Therefore, our research will contribute to realize the role that Beijing?s green spaces are playing in the regulation of rainwater, and to the construction and scientific management of urban green spaces. As our study has demonstrated, there are several lessons for policy, practice and research in order to develop new urban green spaces, enhancing the management effectiveness of existing green spaces, financial innovations to generate resources for sustainable management of green spaces, and local monitoring and local enforcement for effective governance of urban green spaces.},

	abstract = {Rainfed subsistence farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa generally obtain low crop yields as a result of highly erratic rainfall seasons. This paper presents results of research conducted to test the effects of improvements in farming techniques for subsistence rainfed systems. The research was carried out in the Makanya catchment of northern Tanzania where rainfall of less than 600mma-1 and spread over two agricultural seasons per year is clearly insufficient to support staple food crops under the present farming systems in the area. The research sought to prove that, with improved efficiency in tillage techniques, grain yields can improve even under the existing challenging hydro-climatic conditions. The research tested farming system innovations (SIs) at four sites located within a spatial distance of 10km where a combination of runoff diversion (RD), on-site rain water harvesting (WH) and conservation tillage (CT) were compared against the traditional farming methods of hand-hoeing under strict rainfed conditions (Control). For RD, runoff generated from natural storms was directed into infiltration pits dug along the contour with the excavated soil deposited upward of the trenches (fanya juus). The impact of these techniques on maize yields under different SIs was investigated.The results showed that the innovations resulted in increased maize grain yields of up to 4.8tha-1 compared against current averages of less than 1tha-1. The average productivity of the available water over four seasons was calculated to range between 0.35 and 0.51kgm-3. For the SIs that were tested, the distribution of yields within a cultivated strip showed variations with better yields obtained on the down slope side of the cultivated strip where ponding effects resulted in higher water availability for infiltration and storage. However, due to the large seasonal climate variability, statistical analysis did not show significant differences in the yields (p\&lt;0.05) between different cultivation techniques.The study showed that there is scope to improve grain yields with the little available rainfall through the adoption of techniques which promote water availability and retention within the field. The re-partitioning of water within the field creates mitigation measures against the impact of dry spells and allows alternative cropping in addition to the traditional maize cultivated in the rainfall seasons. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Scaling-out of water system innovations such as soil and water conservation is important for increased and sustainable agricultural production. A wealth of upgraded soil and water conservation technologies such as terraces has not been widely adopted in places vulnerable to land degradation and agricultural water stress. Much focus should be on rethinking approaches for scaling-out of well-proved innovations rather than on generation of new technologies. This paper presents an empirical framework for scaling-out water system innovations at catchment level. The framework is built based on findings from studies that were conducted in the Makanya catchment in Northern Tanzania. The empirical data and information were collected through inter-related research methods entailing farmers' questionnaire surveys and consultations with key NGOs involved in the promotion of agricultural land and water management technologies. The data collection involved 234 and 294 farmers in the first and second rounds, respectively. The framework has four stages, which are technology and community strength evaluation, partnership building, scaling-out process and uptake evaluation. Stage 1 evaluates the technology efficacy in conserving soil and water and increasing benefits, and community strength mainly in terms of social capital. Stage 2 entails partnering with the target community and change agents to champion the scaling-out process in the target community. Stage 3 is concerned with the actual innovation scaling-out process through effective pathways such as field demonstration, lead farmers and appropriate channels of communication. Stage 4 evaluates the outcome of the innovation scaling-out process. Though the framework is developed using field evidences related to scaling-out of terraces, it could be adapted to enhance scaling-out of other water system innovations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The research suggested a combination of investments, innovation and better water management policies could help reduce costs, and a key change would be to move away from open furrow/channel-based distribution. It notes further, though, the expectation that irrigation will be under more stress to provide water for higher value uses, especially environmental allocations.

	abstract = {As the pressure on the water resources mounts within a river basin, institutional innovation may occur not as a result of a planned sequence of adjustments, but arising out of the interplay of several factors. By focusing on the basin trajectory this paper illustrates the importance of understanding how local-level institutional arrangements interface with national-level policies and basin-wide institutions. We expand Molle's typology of basin actors responses by explicitly introducing a meso-layer which depicts the interface where State-level and local-level initiatives and responses are played out; and focus on how this interaction finds expression in the creation and modification of hydraulic property rights. We subsequently apply this perspective to the case of Pangani River Basin in Tanzania.The Pangani River Basin development trajectory did not follow a linear path and sequence of responses. Attempts by the state government to establish 'order' in the basin by issuing water rights, levying water fees and designing a new basin institutional set-up have so far proven problematic, and instead generated 'noise' at the interface.So far water resources development in the Pangani has primarily focused on blue water, and the paper shows how investments in infrastructure to control blue water have shaped the relationship between water users, and between water user groups and the State. It remains unknown, however, what the implications will be of widespread investments in improved green water use throughout the basin - not only hydrologically for the availability of blue water, but also socially for the livelihoods of the basin population, and for the evolving relationships between green and blue water users, and between them and the State. The paper concludes with a question: will green water development engender a similar double-edged material-symbolic dynamic as blue water development has.The findings of this paper demonstrate that the expanded typology of basin actors' responses helps to better understand the present situation. Such an improved understanding is useful in analysing current and proposed interventions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Khorezm region is located in the northwest of Uzbekistan, approximately 350km from the current shore of the Aral Sea. It comprises a large-scale irrigation system that conveys water from the river Amu Darya to agricultural land cropped mainly with cotton, wheat, and rice. Khorezm's water resources are vulnerable as they depend on upstream developments and are indispensable to rural livelihoods and state budgets. Since water scarcity is expected to increase in the future, sustainable water management is a necessity. Hence, the objectives of the paper are to: (1) conceptualize the distinctive features of water management in Khorezm; (2) provide an integrated analysis of water management by establishing linkages between society, technical infrastructure, and the bio-physical environment; and (3) make policy and technology recommendations for improved water management. To conceptualize water management in Khorezm, the paper distinguishes three types of practices: formal practices, strategic practices, and discursive practices. Based on these, it presents an analysis of water management on the state water management level, the water user association level, and the farmer and field level. For each level, recommendations are given. The paper concludes that elements of integrated water resources management (IWRM) such as transparency, accountability, participation, and technical efficiency are relevant to improve water management in Khorezm, as elsewhere. In addition, it underlines the need to create legal space for agency and innovation. Technical tools such as models are increasingly important for facilitating transparency and enabling agents to access and make use of information across the management hierarchy. © 2011 The Authors.

This essay addresses three central components of this institutional innovation: processes to reach an ecologically sustainable allocation of water resources; instruments to provide for and protect environmental water; and the development of management frameworks for rivers with environmental water regimes. The discussion explores the considerable constraints encountered in achieving institutions for effective environmental water allocation in the context of the Murray-Darling Basin, the major river basin in south-eastern Australia. Central to this discussion are fundamental questions of governance: who makes substantive decisions on water allocation and management; on what basis and for what purpose? What tools are developing to move towards desired outcomes? How effective are they within the broader institutional context? Given the incremental and, in many cases, ineffective implementation of environmental reform measures to date; and the additional uncertainties, complexities and urgencies posed by climate scenarios; this essay argues for a re-orientation of the policy agenda and its implementation, towards a more purposeful and adaptive governance model. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The nested water and natural resource governance regime across Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, the State of Victoria and the Goulbum-Broken catchment region can be understood to have experienced two major transitions. The first, from a state-based 'nation-building' regime to a more regionally-focused cooperative governance regime, occurred in response to the key landscape drivers of increasing environmental concern and user-pays economic rationalism, prompted by niche-innovation in regional governance. The second, to a federally-focused 'centralized governance' regime, was in response to the landscape drivers of water shortage, overallocation of water resources and resultant environmental degradation, and was institutionalized by legislation and water policy at federal and state levels. The use of legislation has implications for transition pathways and the centralization of decision-making power within the nested set of local, regional, state and federal governance arrangements, as only state and federal levels have the power to legislate.},

The social relevance is high: 1) nutrient reduction and clean water are important pillars in the global protection of scarce freshwater resources; 2) major building block for energy efficient "purification of the future"; 3) reduction of nutrient emissions in the agricultural sector. Degree of cost effectiveness is very high. In comparison with conventional solutions, the costs are lower by a factor of 2. It also delivers a saving of approximately € 3-12 million per 0.01 improvement of the ecological quality index for brooks, lakes, canals and ditches in comparison with current RWS (Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management)/regional packages. Upscalability is large; it is applicable to virtually all STPs (Sewage Treatment Plants) in the Netherlands and abroad and is also applicable for decentralized urine (pre-) treatment. © IWA Publishing 2011.},

We analyze one of the largest point-nonpoint trading programs - the Great Miami Trading Program in Ohio, administered by the Miami Conservancy District (MCD). Our evaluation focuses on the economic and institutional aspects of the program, including cost effectiveness, efficiency of bidding, transaction costs, trading ratios, and innovation. We use a unique dataset consisting of all bids from agricultural nonpoint sources and interviews of soil and water conservation district (SWCD) agents in the watershed. We find that the MCD's reliance on county-level SWCD offices to recruit and advise farmers has been essential to achieve relatively high rates of farmer participation. Additionally, the MCD is able to partly free ride on the administrative costs that SWCD offices receive to assist federal conservation programs, which is helpful to lower costs for a fledgling trading program. However, the involvement of SWCD offices reduced the potential cost savings from the reverse auction structure because some agents were able to learn about the threshold price over the six rounds of bidding and help farmers bid strategically. Overall, the program structure serves as an effective model for future trading programs in other regions that seek to involve agricultural nonpoint sources. © 2011 American Water Resources Association.},

	abstract = {Rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems have supported livelihoods in the five Central Asian countries (CAC) for millennia, but concerns for sustainability and efficient use of land and water resources are long-standing. During the last 50 years, resource conserving technologies were introduced in large parts of the rainfed areas while the irrigated areas were expanded largely without considering resource conservation. In more recent years, the use of conservation agriculture (CA) practices has been reported for the different agricultural production (AP) zones in CAC, albeit centering on a single AP zone or on single factors such as crop yield, implements or selected soil properties. Moreover, conflicting information exists regarding whether the current practices that are referred to as 'CA' can indeed be defined as such. Overall information on an application of CA-based crop management in Central Asia is incomplete. This discussion paper evaluates experimental evidence on the performance of CA and other resource conserving technologies in the three main AP zones of CAC, provides an overview of farmer adoption of production practices related to CA, and outlines technical and non-technical challenges and opportunities for the future dissemination of CA practices in each zone. Agronomic (e.g. implements, crop yields, duration, and crop residues), institutional (e.g. land tenure) and economic (e.g. short vs. long-term profitability) perspectives are considered. At present, adoption of CA-based agronomic practices in the rainfed production zone is limited to partial crop residue retention on the soil surface or sporadically zero tillage for one crop out of the rotation, and hence the use of single CA components but not the full set of CA practices. In the irrigated AP zones, CA is not commonly practiced and many of the pre-conditions that typically encourage the rapid spread of CA practices appear to be absent or limiting. Further, our analysis suggests that given the diversity of institutional, socio-economic and agro-ecological contexts, a geographically differentiated approach to CA dissemination is required in the CAC. Immediate priorities should include a shift in research paradigms (e.g. towards more participatory approaches with farmers), development of commercially available reduced and no-till seeders suitable for smaller-scale farm enterprises, and advocacy so that decision makers understand how different policies may encourage or discourage innovations that lead towards more sustainable agricultural intensification in the CAC. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

It is guided by the principle that socio-economic development should consider the carrying capacity of the ecosystem and focuses on institutional innovation, building on the water rights concept. This paper explores the innovation process during the transition towards WSS by investigating the development course of the innovation process during the transition towards WSS, and the adaptive capacity of the existing water management regime underlying the innovation process. Accordingly, an analysis framework consisting of three types of governance activities and factors determining a regime's adaptive capacity was developed, based on the theory of transition management and adaptive governance. The Tianjin and Zhangye WSS experiments were selected for a deep understanding of local innovations. It is revealed that co-evolution of all three types of governance activities that are claimed to be essential for transition has taken place. However, the current adaptive capacity of the regime still needs further enhancement to support the transition towards the desired WSS in China. Finally, some general insights are provided for policy innovations in other political economies. © IWA Publishing 2012.},

WFD implementation also requires the participation of many stakeholders (administrators, farmers and citizens) with the aim of improving the quality of river waters and basin ecosystems through cooperative planning. This approach encompasses different issues, such as agro-ecology, land use planning and water management. This paper presents the results of a methodology suggested for implementing the WFD in the case of the Seveso river contract in Italy, one of the recent WFD applications. The Seveso basin in the Lombardy region has been one of the most rapidly urbanizing areas in Italy over the last 50 years. First, land use changes in the last 50 years are assessed with the use of historical aerial photos. Then, elements of an ecological network along the river corridor are outlined, and different scenarios for enhancing existing ecological connections are assessed using indicators from graph theory. These scenarios were discussed in technical workshops with involved stakeholders of the river contract. The results show a damaged rural landscape, where urbanization processes have decimated the system of linear green features (hedges/rows). Progressive reconnections of some of the identified network nodes may significantly increase the connectivity and circuitry of the study area. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

Such a private conservation tool is yet to be established in the UK, but innovation by an environmental charity seeks to mitigate the impacts of diffuse pollution from agriculture on water quality. Under the agreements a one-off payment would be made for agreed restrictions on use of targeted areas of farmland. This paper places the proposed agreements within a hierarchy of approaches for water resources protection, and characterises them as a variant of Payments for Ecosystems Services. It reports the results of an innovative two-stage deliberative survey of the attitudes of a small sample of landowners located evenly across three catchments in South West England. A majority of respondents were receptive to the propositions and characteristics of the agreements. Seventy-five percent expressed interest in entering land into a scheme based on such agreements, but observed variation by landowner profile and farm type merits further investigation. Respondents interested in the agreements referred to current land values as a starting point for compensation required. The longevity of proposed agreements is an obstacle for some landowners; a cause for concern given the objective of 'permanent' water resource protection. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper we describe competence formation and competence needs in a case study of the Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR) in the Ministry of Public Works in Indonesia. A framework is introduced for the water sector comprising three aggregate competences for technical issues, management, and governance, and a meta-competence for continuous learning and innovation. The four competences are further organised in a T-shaped competence profile. Though DGWR professionals have a firmly "technical" orientation, both surveys and interviews reveal a strong perceived requirement for other competences: in particular the learning meta-competence, as well as the aggregate competence for management. The aggregate competence for governance systematically scores lower. Further, a discrepancy appears to exist between the competences that staff perceive as needed in daily work, and those that can be acquired during post-graduate water education. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} In both locally-based and international post-graduate water education, the aggregate competences for management as well as governance are reportedly addressed modestly, if at all. With low competence in these fields, it is difficult for professionals to communicate and collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary way. As a result, the horizontal bar of the T-shaped profile remains weakly developed. In international post-graduate education, this is partially compensated by the attention to continuous learning and innovation. The exposure to a different culture and learning format is experienced as fundamentally formative. © 2012 Author(s).},

Its sources and effects are multiple and diffused in nature and it requires detailed assessment and policy. This paper discusses the global extent of the problem, its sources and effects and explores different policy options. Sources and pathways of interaction require comprehensive assessment and policy. Innovation in low cost technologies offers possibilities for reducing abatement cost and for economic efficiency. To reduce arsenic in water resources, incentive policies such as taxing and subsidising can be used to reduce arsenic levels in point sources through creation of appropriate incentives. The paper also identifies opportunities for enhancing self-protection efforts through education and information sharing. Under a self-protection policy, though the damages decline to a greater extent, there is a possibility of an increase in arsenic emission. Finally, a combination of policies is proposed that involve low cost technology, education and awareness to mitigate the damage from arsenic contamination at a watershed scale. It is also necessary to enforce these policies through appropriate institutional changes that involve coordination and cooperative efforts to mitigate arsenic contamination.

	abstract = {During the recent decades, global climate change recognized as one of the most serious challenges facing the world - its people, the environment and its economies. Agriculture will face significant challenges in the 21st century, largely due to the need to increase global food supply under the declining availability of soil and water resources and increasing threats from climate change. Nonetheless, these challenges also offer opportunities to develop and promote food and livelihood systems that have greater environmental, economic and social resilience to risk. It is clear that success in meeting these challenges will require both the application of current multidisciplinary knowledge, and the development of a range of technical and institutional innovations. The changing climate is also a major challenge for agriculture and agricultural policy-making. Agriculture needs to address the double challenge of reducing its greenhouse gases emissions (GHGs) while at the same time adapting to projected impacts of climate change. In 2003, Nobel Laureate Richard E. Smalley outlined Humanity's Top Ten Problems for the next 50 years, in a talk given for the MIT Enterprise Forum. According to Professor Smalley, the biggest problems facing humanity are: Energy, Water, Food, Environment, Poverty, Terrorism and War, Disease, Education, Democracy and Population. The goal of the present study is to summarize main findings regarding some of these problems focusing on changes in climate conditions and to provide an overview of major challenges facing the global food and agricultural system in the 21st century and the impacts of the climate change. In the future, the review studies will focus on expanding the research for some specific challenges of climate change (Drought, cold, salinity) and its impact on agriculture.},

	abstract = {Water scarcity caused by increased demands often leads to competition and conflict over water in many river catchments in Sub-Saharan Africa. At the local level, water users have in many places been able to solve water allocation problems by crafting institutions based on customs and traditions. These self-governing arrangements are not necessarily fair or good, but are able to adapt to the changing resource context. Simultaneously, many African governments have adopted new policies and laws, and established new institutions to achieve equitable and sustainable management of water resources. The formalization of the property right to water is often part of the recipe. This paper analyses the impact of one such government-led formalization process on local water allocation practices. Based on a field study in the Hingilili sub-catchment, Tanzania, we find that government interventions do not achieve the goal of equitable and sustainable water management. However, we find that the principle of good neighbourhood that still exists between the highland and lowland farmers in Hingilili could form a base to reconcile diverging water interests between the highland and lowland farmers. The paper shows that the concept of bricolage [Cleaver, F., 2002. Reinventing institutions: bricolage and the social embeddedness of natural resourcemanagement. TheEuropean Journal ofDevelopmentResearch, 14 (2), 11-30] is useful to demonstrate the need for new institutions to be sufficiently embedded in existing local practices to succeed, but this is not a sufficient condition. The hydraulic position of the various actors (upstream or downstream) must also be taken into account, and may be considered a driver for institutional innovation. © 2012 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.},

	abstract = {This study contributes a rigorous diagnostic assessment of state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and highlights key advances that the water resources field can exploit to better discover the critical tradeoffs constraining our systems. This study provides the most comprehensive diagnostic assessment of MOEAs for water resources to date, exploiting more than 100,000 MOEA runs and trillions of design evaluations. The diagnostic assessment measures the effectiveness, efficiency, reliability, and controllability of ten benchmark MOEAs for a representative suite of water resources applications addressing rainfall-runoff calibration, long-term groundwater monitoring (LTM), and risk-based water supply portfolio planning. The suite of problems encompasses a range of challenging problem properties including (1) many-objective formulations with four or more objectives, (2) multi-modality (or false optima), (3) nonlinearity, (4) discreteness, (5) severe constraints, (6) stochastic objectives, and (7) non-separability (also called epistasis). The applications are representative of the dominant problem classes that have shaped the history of MOEAs in water resources and that will be dominant foci in the future. Recommendations are given for the new algorithms that should serve as the benchmarks for innovations in the water resources literature. The future of MOEAs in water resources needs to emphasize self-adaptive search, new technologies for visualizing tradeoffs, and the next generation of computing technologies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Accordingly, elegant designs like qanats became an indispensable element of hydraulic systems, while institutional frameworks were innovated to be combined with in water resource management. Evidence shows that hydraulic structures and water establishments date back thousands of years known as cultural heritage. Besides, the ancient Iranians have realized the importance of an organization to supervise irrigation and water conveyance. Thus, during the Achaemenid and Sasanian Empires, water engineering was developed significantly through the whole territory. The governmental endorsements associated with contemporary engineered structures have made extensive innovations in water systems, such as canals, watermills, water treatment, water storage, piping and construction. The infrastructure fulfilled a wide range of necessities of a civilized country and assisted in achieving its golden era.

Seven metaphor clusters - performance metaphors, action metaphors, communication metaphors, governance mechanism metaphors, social learning as a paradigm, social learning as a form of cognition and social learning as a wheelbarrow full of frogs, were identified from the sustainability and natural resource management (NRM) literature. Rather than seeking to define social learning rigidly, and thus limiting its potential utility to open up spaces for innovation in NR governance, social learning can be positioned in future discourse so that it holds a cluster of revealing and concealing features. This position shifts responsibility for clarity and rigour away from the concept, useful because of its fluidity, to the user of the concept who must then articulate the way(s) in which they choose to use it. This shift is consistent with reflexive, systems practice for systemic and adaptive governance and invites practitioner responsibility rather than conceptual reification. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The research is based on document review, a focus group and 29 interviews conducted with academic experts, project proponents, government and watershed agencies representatives, non-governmental organization researchers, First Nations, and others with interest in the GRW. Information was gathered on existing policy and planning instruments, and relationships among the authorities and other partners that enable water resource management. Key facilitating factors for W-CEAM in the GRW include established institutions, a mature conservation authority and an ecological focus to resource management strategies, while constraining factors include obfuscation of leadership roles and lack of multi-scalar approaches to watershed science. We conclude that it is useful to conceptualize W-CEAM as characterized by both a managerial and a scientific ethos - the former facilitating the latter - and that institutional goodwill, political will and institutional capacity for innovation and creativity are additional institutional core requisites to W-CEAM. © 2013 Copyright IAIA.},

At a country level, some populations use more water than they control because of their ability to import food and the virtual water required for its production. Here, we investigate the dependence of demographic growth on available water resources for exporting and importing nations. By quantifying the carrying capacity of nations on the basis of calculations of the virtual water available through the food trade network, we point to the existence of a global water unbalance. We suggest that current export rates will not be maintained and consequently we question the long-term sustainability of the food trade system as a whole. Water-rich regions are likely to soon reduce the amount of virtual water they export, thus leaving import-dependent regions without enough water to sustain their populations. We also investigate the potential impact of possible scenarios that might mitigate these effects through (i) cooperative interactions among nations whereby water-rich countries maintain a tiny fraction of their food production available for export, (ii) changes in consumption patterns, and (iii) a positive feedback between demographic growth and technological innovations. We find that these strategies may indeed reduce the vulnerability of water-controlled societies.},

	abstract = {summary: Biomass, Biovalue and Sustainability: Some Thoughts on the Definition of the Bioeconomy The success of innovation policies addressing the bioeconomy - and particularly those related to agriculture and food - will depend on how the concept is translated into policies, and therefore on how the term is understood and defined. In this article, different 'clusters' of definitions are considered, alternatively biotechnologies, biomass, and biochemical and biophysical processes as key criteria for identification. It is argued that none of these definitions properly address the issue of sustainability. In fact, a 'broad' definition of bioeconomy, encompassing all biochemical and biophysical processes, would make it useless for policy purposes. The article proposes building a definition of the bioeconomy around the concept of biovalue. It identifies the goal of the bioeconomy as the capacity to mobilise science to obtain high biovalue returns from low-cost living matter, for example organic waste, and includes the value of non-market goods associated with agriculture and food. In this regard, a distinction is made between 'natural biovalue', produced by quality agriculture, and 'biotechnological biovalue'. It is argued that the bioeconomy and the production of natural biovalue deserve specific attention and that a sustainable bioeconomy should not undermine the potential of natural biovalue through competition for the same land and water resources. © 2013 The Agricultural Economics Society and the European Association of Agricultural Economists.},

In this context, research and innovation play a strategic role reinforcing the efficiency of water policies. The present study provides a multilevel assessment of research and innovation practices in the field of water resource management in southern European countries and regions (more specifically; Cyprus, Albania, Poitou-Charentes in France, Andalusia in Spain and the North of Portugal). The analysis was based on a strategic framework aimed at gaining an insight of the current constraints, as well as of the existing and future technological solutions for a better water resource management. The triple helix model proved to be a useful analytical framework for assessing the efforts of different groups towards a common goal. The analysis proved the existence of a significant evolution in the use of technological tools to assist decision-making processes in integrated river basin management in all regions. Nevertheless, the absence of formal channels for knowledge and data exchange between researchers and water resource managers complicates the formers involvement in the decision-making process regarding water allocation. Both researchers and consultants emphasize the low availability of data, together with the need to advance on water resource economics as relevant constraints in the field.

Recognition that models play a significant role in the formulation and implementation of design and management strategies has encouraged the profession to consider how such models can be best implemented. Shared Vision Planning (SVP) is a disciplined planning approach that combines traditional water resources planning methodologies with innovations such as structured public participation and the use of collaborative modeling, resulting in a more complete understanding and an integrative decision support tool. This study reviews these three basic components of SVP and explains how they are incorporated into a unified planning approach. The successful application of SVP is explored in three studies involving planning challenges: the National Drought Study, the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Study, and the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint/Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin Study.

Society is faced with the challenge of finding solutions to complex and interrelated problems such as living safely in densely populated deltas, planning ahead for climate change, finding alternatives to fossil fuels, and urban redevelopment.

This paper elaborates on the need to transition towards water-sensitive cities, drawing on the experience of urban water management and water-sensitive urban design in the Netherlands and the UK. This transition involves strengthening the integration of water in spatial planning and design processes, requiring any spatial intervention or new development to be evaluated on opportunities for sustainability and innovation. Design tools or building blocks are suggested that enable the transition to a city in which the awareness of water, energy, nature and living environment are connected, in which developments always take place in a resilient and climateproof way, and where water can be a focus for enjoyment and vitality.

	abstract = {Since the 2007 food crisis, the Government of Benin has created enabling conditions that urge small scale farmers to intensify rice production in inland valleys. Unsuitable irrigation infrastructures and lack of willingness to act collectively has led farmers to complain about water shortage. Adoption of mitigating technologies offered by government (extension) and scientists (e.g. Benin Agricultural Research Institute, AfricaRice) has been low due to the institutional context within which farmers are working. A socio-technical approach which combines technical and institutional dimensions was used to identify and test mulching as a potential method for improving irrigation water efficiency in growing rice in upland parts of Benin's inland valleys. Rice farmers (from three production areas), an extension agent and a researcher formed a multi-stakeholder platform and collaborated to test the application of mulch (three doses) and the use of a lowland rice variety in replacement of an upland rice variety during two growing seasons. Multiple methods derived from researchers and farmers' perspectives were used to evaluate trial results: quantitative scientific evidence was combined with qualitative evaluation using indicators agreed upon by the collaborative group. Results show that the lowland rice variety IR-841 with 10Mgha-1 'rice-straw' mulch allows farmers to better use available water in the upland areas and increase yields. Although the preference for IR-841 over the special bred upland variety Nerica-4 is risky because of its high water demand and the uncertainty in rainfall, farmers use IR-841 for profit maximisation. Beyond its technical output, the joint experimentation facilitated the interaction of knowledge, experiences and practices among the involved actors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Seasonal climate forecasting skill has improved over the past decades, accompanied by expectations that these forecasts, along with other climate information, will be increasingly used by water managers in certain regions of the United States. Most research efforts focus on why adoption does not occur; however, the important question of why adoption does occur has received little attention. Barriers to the use of climate information by this sector frequently identified include risk aversion, institutional constraints, and low forecast reliability. Relatively fewer researchers have focused on the identification and analysis of cases of adoption of climate information in the water management sector. Relying upon the results from observations and semistructured interviews conducted between 2006 and 2010 in South Florida, this research identifies the characteristics that enabled the early adoption of climate information by the South Florida Water Management District, one of the largest water management organizations in the United States. The findings herein are analyzed in relation to existing theories on technology transfer and innovation diffusion. Lessons from this specific case are situated in the context of the broader U.S. water management landscape. The research finds that the existence of in-house climate expertise, innovative agency culture, social networks linking water and climate science researchers, and serendipitous policy windows were critical factors enabling adoption. Additionally, models and information, including a long-range hydrologic model and a national government- issued seasonal climate forecast were readily available and could be incorporated into preexisting and trusted decision-support tools. Implications for climate services in the U.S. water sector are discussed. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Biorefineries are expected to take over the production of chemicals and biofuels in the coming decades, in parallel to the depletion of fossil resources. Considerable research efforts have been made to develop efficient (bio)catalytic systems for the production of bio-based solvents and novel products with improved ecological footprints and "smart" properties. Among other challenges, water consumption will be an important aspect to assess in the full sustainability of biorefineries, which are envisaged for large-scale operations. The already existing fresh water shortage in many regions of our overpopulated planet has brought more pressure and uncertainties to these aims. Thus, over the past years, a number of enzymatic, fermentative, and chemocatalytic applications using seawater as a reaction medium for large-scale biorefineries have been reported by several research groups, which emphasize the use of nonpotable water resources for coastal regions and for locally available biomass (e.g., algae). This article contextualizes in detail these seawater-based applications for biorefineries. Overall, the use of such nonpotable water resources is promising, provided that applied catalytic systems can lead to straightforwardly treatable waste(sea)water effluents. Opportunities at the interface between biology, chemistry, and chemical engineering are foreseeable for (holistic) innovation and further research. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.},

Building the capacity of water professionals to lead the changes in policy, planning, management and communities required to tackle these issues systemically is an essential component of our collective response to global water challenges. This paper provides a contribution to the fields of water leadership and capacity development by outlining, then critically discussing how a concept, the T-shaped professional, is being used as a framework to guide the design and delivery of postgraduate education programs to build leadership capacity in the water sector. The T-shaped concept integrates insights from leadership, learning theory, collaboration, critical thinking and praxis.

It describes the significance of water to indigenous people living in the Roper River area of Australia's Northern Territory, reports on innovations in water allocation planning processes aimed at accommodating that significance, and analyses the implications of this case study for water planning generally. We describe rich cultural and historical connections with water places, protocols governing human conduct towards water, custodial assertions regarding the need for "water for the country", distinctive values relating to riparian vegetation, and claims of ownership and economic rights in contemporary water allocations. Current water planning objectives such as sustainable development, protection for groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and protection of indigenous values accord with contemporary indigenous perspectives in the Roper, and in a national first, the local water plan specifically proposes reserving a significant water allocation for commercial use by indigenous people. Yet that allocation is seen as unjust from a local perspective, and further analysis demonstrates a range of other limitations: the scale and boundedness of the demarcated plan area, the neglect of riparian vegetation management, insufficient resourcing of local indigenous capacity, mismatches in planning and local governance structures, and the broader question of whether a rationalist planning process can simultaneously advance indigenous claims for recognition, equity in distributions and parity in participation. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor \& Francis.},

	abstract = {In China, water shortage and water pollution are pronounced challenges. The limited water resources are poorly managed. Despite a lack of water, China is committed to being food self-sufficient, which requires extensive irrigation. The paradoxical ambitions of reducing water shortage and promoting food self-sufficiency are supported by technological innovation and costly engineering projects. Yet, these attempts will ultimately fail to bridge the gap between water demand and supply. China's continued economic growth presents difficult problems and new prospects in the context of water and food security. On one hand, a growing number of wealthier, urban Chinese consumers are demanding water-intensive food products, which cannot be sustainably produced in China in light of heavy irrigation requirements and continued population growth. On the other hand, the economic growth opens a window of opportunity for China to include virtual water trade as a component of its water policies. China is reluctant to embrace this trade because it perceives it to have a negative effect on its national security. It appears that China's security axis must shift. It cannot maintain its growing population and economy while preserving current levels of water, food, and national security simultaneously. A policy change is needed. It is argued, therefore, that the policy relevance of virtual water trade must be addressed, and the water shortage-induced imperative of food imports must be given appropriate attention. © 2013 National Association of Environmental Professionals.},

	abstract = {Notwithstanding ambiguities, long-term economic resurgence in Afghanistan amidst water insecurity exacerbated by climate change decisively requires a water protection strategy that will complement a multitude of agroindustrial and socioeconomic activities in an environmentally sustainable and climate resilient manner. In this paper, we begin with a perspective on institutions, legislation, and key issues in the water sector of Afghanistan. We then embark on linking the integrated water resources management (IWRM) and strategic environmental assessment (SEA) approaches as a novel framework for strategic water management and subsequently propose a strategy for post-conflict water protection based on the coalesced IWRM and SEA. Context relevant good practices worldwide are presented to provide empirical evidence for this approach whereas perceived opportunities and vulnerabilities in the Afghan context are discussed. Examination of post-conflict water sector initiatives in Afghanistan reveals the critical role of foreign assistance in both water infrastructure rehabilitation and modernization of the institutional aspect of water management. The introduction of IWRM as the basis for a progressive water sector strategy has been seen as a major milestone which is detrimentally matched by substantial deficiency in national capacity for implementation. Concurrently, the role of extra-national actors in relevant policy interventions has been considered catalytic despite criticisms of proposed regulations as being anachronistic to field realities. Therefore the view is maintained to practicable policies by accelerating policy learning in the country's water and environment sectors to encourage homegrown water strategy innovations. Demonstratively, mainstreaming IWRM-SEA coalescence will bridge institutional gaps for better feedback between local and national water stakeholders, providing a venue for improved delivery of water services to sustain post-conflict socioeconomic recovery and promote environmental stewardship.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The African continent has been severely affected by the HIV and AIDS pandemic and as a consequence,development is being obstructed. Agriculture and food production systems are changing as a result of the burden of the pandemic. Many farming families are experiencing trauma from morbidity and mortalityas well as facing labour losses and exhaustion. To further exacerbate the situation, climate variability and change reduce the available water supply for domestic and productive uses. This article describes how these multiple stressors play out in Nyanza province in Western Kenya and explores livelihood responses to water stress in Onjiko location, Nyanza. In this community, widows and divorced women affected by HIV and AIDS have become agents of positive change. Data from local surveys (2007), mapping of seasonal calendars (September 2009) and numerous focus group meetings and interviews with women in Onjiko (October 2008, January 2010, January 2011), reveal that despite a negative fall-back position, widows are improving their households' water and food security. This adaptation and even mitigation to some of the experienced climate impacts are emerging from their new activities in a setting of changing conditions. In the capacity of main livelihood providers, widows are gaining increased decision making and bargaining power. As such they can invest in sustainable innovations like rain water harvesting systems and agroforestry. Throughout, they work together in formalized groups of collective action that capitalize on the pooling of natural and human resources as well as planned financial management during hardship periods. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Its key innovations include the fact that it comes with all data required for application, is very high spatial resolution (1 km or 1-hectare resolution) and yet global in extent and is particularly well suited to heterogeneous environments with little or no available data. The model, WaterWorld, is capable of producing a hydrological baseline representing the mean water balance for 1950-2000 and allows users to apply ensemble scenarios for climate change or examine the impact of policy options for land cover change or land management interventions. WaterWorld is focused on policy support, especially in conservation hydrology and development applications and is delivered through a simple web interface, requiring little local capacity for use. The paper discusses the paucity of hydrological data and the urgency of hydrological problems in much of the less-developed world, which reinforce the need for tools like WaterWorld. We discuss the types of hydrological problems that models might contribute to managing and the requirements of models applied to such problems.

Not surprisingly, there are a greater number of comparative studies between rural and urban water conservation within each country. The search also identified different conservation emphases in the two countries, e.g., rainwater harvesting in India compared with stormwater quality management in the United States. It identified unanticipated publications and lines of comparative water conservation (e.g. comparative physiology). Some transnational research goes beyond comparison to address the diffusion of innovations, i.e. research linkages as well as comparisons, although these studies are also few. The more prevalent pattern involves parallel literatures, which indicate substantial opportunities for future comparative and transnational research. This review also identified diffusion of international knowledge paths that are not the product of formal comparative research. The final section focuses on the prospects and priorities for future international and inter-sectoral research, e.g. paired multi-objective river basin research, linkages between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, diffusion of water conservation innovations, and synthesis of research on urban and rural rainwater harvesting in different countries.},

Over 1 600 questions were collected, reduced in number and prioritised by specialists working in water research and practice. A total of 59 questions were finally proposed as an outcome of the study and are categorised under the themes of change, data, ecosystems, governance, innovation and resources. The questions range in scale, challenge and urgency, and are also aligned with prevailing paradigms in water research. The majority of the questions dealt with relatively short- to medium-term research requirements and most focused on immediate issues such as water supply, service delivery and technical solutions. Formulations of long-term research questions were sparse, partly because some of the principles and methods used in this study were difficult to apply in the South African context, and also because researchers are influenced by addressing what are believed to be the more immediate, short-term water-related challenges in South Africa. This is the first initiative of its kind to produce a comprehensive and inclusive list of research priorities for water in South Africa.},

All case studies, which originated from the SLIM (Social Learning for the Integrated Management and Sustainable Use of Water at Catchment Scale) Project, funded within the EU Fifth Framework Program (2001-2004), constitute inquiry pathways that are explored using a critical incident approach. The initial starting conditions for each inquiry pathway are compared; significant pathway dependencies are identified which foster the development of social learning processes locally, but constrain their uptake and embedding across the wider system of interest. In the first case study, in England \& Wales, promising developments in the application of social learning approaches to river basin planning over an initial 3-year period were subsequently marginalised, only to resurface towards the end of the 10-year period of study. In the second, South African case study, significant spaces for social learning and innovation in integrated water resources management were opened up over a five year period but closed down again, primarily as the result of lack of policy support by national government. The third, Italian, case study was designed to assess options for adapting to climate change by opening up new learning spaces between researchers, stakeholders and policy makers. A case for investing in local level systemic innovation through social-learning praxis design approaches and in learning processes around well contextualised case-studies is supported. However, concomitant investment by policy makers in social learning as an alternative, but complementary, governance mechanism for systemic innovation for SD is needed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The water crisis is often said to be a crisis of governance failure rather than of availability per se; yet the sources of this failure are poorly understood. This paper examines contemporary water scarcity in England and Wales as a failure of ecological modernity, in which technical and institutional innovation is promoted as a means of increasing economic efficiency in the allocation and use of water resources. The role of the state in fostering this innovation is explored through exploring a shift from 'government' to 'governance'. The paper employs Jessop's theory of meta-governance to examine governance failure. Meta-governance represents the capacity of the state to flank or support the emergence of specific forms of governance through mobilising material or symbolic resources. Three sources of governance failure are explored: (1) the nature of capitalist exchange and its resulting production of nature, (2) the political dimensions implicit in meta-governance, and (3) the nature of governance as a task of self-organisation. The model is then applied to the rise of water scarcity in England and Wales from the 1970s to the present day. The utility of the model in analysing governance failure is discussed.},

Applied to open water systems, MPC provides integrated, optimal, and proactive management, when forecasts are available. Notwithstanding these properties, if forecast uncertainty is not properly taken into account, the system performance can critically deteriorate.Ensemble forecast is a way to represent short-term forecast uncertainty. An ensemble forecast is a set of possible future trajectories of a meteorological or hydrological system. The growing ensemble forecasts' availability and accuracy raises the question on how to use them for operational management.The theoretical innovation presented here is the use of ensemble forecasts for optimal operation. Specifically, we introduce a tree based approach. We called the new method Tree-Based Model Predictive Control (TB-MPC). In TB-MPC, a tree is used to set up a Multistage Stochastic Programming, which finds a different optimal strategy for each branch and enhances the adaptivity to forecast uncertainty. Adaptivity reduces the sensitivity to wrong forecasts and improves the operational performance.TB-MPC is applied to the operational management of Salto Grande reservoir, located at the border between Argentina and Uruguay, and compared to other methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Persistent severe drought and extreme flooding episodes have presented new challenges in the region. Chief among these challenges is the establishment of a legitimate framework to sustainably manage water resources that finds common ground between environmental, indigenous and commercial interests. A powerful approach to examine these processes is through the theory of diffusion and adaptation of policy innovations. Here, we describe an approach to place this theory on empirical ground using Q methodology. We elucidate patterns of subjectivity, to explore the perceptions of expert advice, subsidiarity and local knowledge to better understand the interests in play. We find that respect is held for local practitioners (water managers and farmers) and indigenous knowledge, but while policy innovations are being generated, the diffusion of policy is contested. We identify the potential, though limited, for common ground through substantive and respectful consultation. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

At the current stage of research, a predictive modelling technique, known as rule-based classification, was used to find rules that can, based on the values of certain chemical parameters, predict the ecotoxicity level of a water sample. We used data from water analyses from main water bodies of São Paulo state in Brazil, from 2005 to 2010. We expect to get a reliable, fast and effective way to predict the ecotoxicity levels of water in rivers, lakes and reservoirs based on analyses of chemical parameters, or indicate the complementarity of these measurements for optimisation of monitoring networks and the consequent improvement natural resources management.

This paper makes policy recommendations to address climate change and sea level rise challenges in small island developing states. Using Barbados as a case study, the paper found that innovations in policies and projects have offset the past ills of mass tourism and fortuitously now serve as pre-emptive measures in adapting to climate change. The array of methods for combating these changes includes physical planning policies, integrated coastal zone management, and infrastructure projects. Among the key areas for policy innovation are the adoption of protection, accommodation, and retreat strategies, which are informed by rigorous cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder consultation. Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change is also necessary, especially for islands where coral reef protection is urgent. Moreover, policy adjustments are required on building construction, water resources management, sewage treatment, coastal zone management, physical planning, and land management. Institutional constraints, including the lack of capacity to implement, monitor, and enforce measures, must also be addressed if progress is to be made in adapting to climate change. A major conclusion is that the severity of coastal damage, the importance of tourism to sustainable development, and the country's adaptive capacity play a key part in the selection and implementation of climate change adaptation measures. © 2013 United Nations.},

The strategic goals of water tariffs must include savings, efficient management and equity in order to optimise availability of the best quality water. The main domestic uses of water are food preparation, personal hygiene and household cleaning; not all of them need the same quality, and for some of them there are even potential substitutes. In order to contribute to this debate, we need to know how these different uses are valued by direct users. This article focuses on eliciting values for different domestic uses, using discrete choice experiments. As far as we know, this is the first time that a differentiated valuation per use has been defined. The paper introduces three innovations in the design of the experiment. The design takes into account decisive variables in household water consumption, such as family size, together with the consumption level, and the options offered in the choice task are combinations of different prices for each of the uses. A latent class model with both common and class-specific random parameters is applied to better account for the influence of heterogeneity in the respondents' choices. The results show that the most valued use depends on the consumption level class. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The environment and the health of mankind are subject to strong pressures from pollutants. The ambition of a better quality of life is often frustrated by the increase in emissions as a result of the increasing consumption of resources and energy to satisfy the growth of the world’s population and its expectations for socioeconomic development. At times, problems take on a planetary dimension, the best known example being greenhouse gas emission, with the resulting effects of climate change. Pollution highlights our failure to provide adequate education, which is essential if we are to become fully aware of problems and actively seek sustainable solutions. To this end, it is essential to set up an extended environmental and health education program in all communities that will accompany younger generations from the beginning of their education in order to make them conscious players in protecting the environment and their own health. The size of the problems requires that a joint effort be made at an international level in the political realm and in the scientific-cultural realm in order to share experiences and sensitivity and to seek joint solutions. It is necessary to assign an increasingly important role to scientific and technological innovation which, in the last century, from Marconi to Einstein to Fleming, to the most recent innovations in the fields of genomics and microchips, has allowed humanity to achieve a rate of growth of wellbeing never previously seen in its thousands of years of history. This innovation must rationally be entrusted with our expectations to provide a practical solution to the problems of pollution that threaten our everyday lives and the survival of the planet.

	abstract = {Adaptive water resources management recognizes the centrality of learning to its effective implementation. However, the literature on learning in Adaptive Management (AM) is disjointed and lacks rigorous treatment. The purpose of this paper is to clarify how learning associated with AM is distinctive and to explain the importance of successfully integrating it into policy design. Because adaptive learning holds a unique position within the adaptive management and assessment process, it should serve as the basis for a systematic redesign of water policy processes. Adaptive environmental assessment and management processes, which highlight the role of adaptive learning, are built upon in this paper. For the purpose of this paper, adaptive learning is defined as “an ongoing process of inquiry that incorporates new knowledge with the aim to continually improve management policies”. In order for adaptive learning to live with and profit from nature’s dynamism, it is argued that it must be problem-centered, decision relevant, reflective, and inherently transformative. When this kind of learning becomes a fully integrated component of AM, water resource institutions have a greater likelihood of maturing into actual “learning systems”. The specific objectives of this paper are to: 1) redefine what adaptive learning is, 2) explain how this particular type of learning is distinctive and 3) outline the role of adaptive learning in policy formation. Regarding policy design, the paramount issue is determining how to respond to the speed, scale, and complexity of the planetary challenges. This paper draws on a number of related areas of research to present propositions for increasing the adaptive capacity of water organizations. These research topics include: demonstrating how adaptive learning should be integrated into policy design; establishing new standards of practice that are based on adaptive learning rather than achieving ‘optimal’ end-game solutions; using the breakthrough views in order to transform learning into effective action; framing management problems in non-reductionist ways so that nature may serve as an ally and pilot; using shadow networks to inspire innovation, encourage institutional learning, and improve governance rules; and creating a new social reality that is more future-responsive to problems and more hospitable to new ways of thinking about water management. © 2014, (publisher).

The observed decrease in glacier volume over the last few decades is likely to accelerate during the current century, which will affect water availability in the region. This paper presents an approach for participatory development of community-based adaptation measures to cope with the projected impacts of climate change. It combines in an innovative manner participatory design with physical measurements, modeling and a vulnerability analysis. Vulnerability to drought is made operational for households in a catchment of the Ocoña River basin in Peru. On the basis of a household survey (n = 94) we explore how a vulnerability index (risk divided by response efficacy) can be used to assess the distribution of vulnerability over households, and how socio-economic factors determine this vulnerability. Water entitlement, area of irrigated land, income and education are all significantly correlated with vulnerability to drought. The research showed that the main source of spring water is local rainwater, and that water use efficiency is low. The selected adaptation measures aimed to increase water availability close to farmland, and increase water use efficiency of farmers and households. © 2015 by the authors, licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The development of water-saving irrigation equipment has taken nearly for 60 years, a considerable progress has been made in its theoretical study and technical level and so on; further the scale of production can basically meet the development of water-saving irrigation in China, but the ability in technological innovation, research and development is weaker, the improvements in product quality, technical performance and reliability are on demand. The developing trends in water-saving irrigation equipment should include strengthening basic theoretical study, enhancing the capability of independent innovation, designing and manufacturing intelligent, precise, cheap and green water-saving irrigation equipment with multi-function, low energy consumption and cost. It is suggested that the comprehensive technology and equipment for water-saving irrigation in hilly land should be investigated. The multi-function, intelligent and precise sprinkler irrigation systems should be developed. Also, the irrigation technology and equipment with low cost, high efficiency and collaborative precision in water and pesticide spraying as well as fertilizing should be innovated. The water-saving irrigation technology and equipment by using clean energy should be exploited.

The potential widespread application of hydraulic fracturing has raised concerns over deleterious environmental impacts on fragile water resources. We discuss the environmental management challenges faced by the oil and gas industry, and the opportunities for innovation in the industry. Abstract The need for cheap and readily available energy and chemical feedstock, and the desire for energy independence have spurred worldwide interest in the development of unconventional oil and gas resources; in particular, the production of oil and gas from shale formations. Although these resources have been known for a long time, the technical expertise and market forces that enable economical development has coincided over the last 15 years. The amalgamation of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have enabled favourable economics for development of fossil energy from these unconventional reservoirs, but their potential widespread application has raised concerns over deleterious environmental impacts on fragile water resources. The environmental management challenges faced by the oil and gas industry arise from local water availability and infrastructure for treating and disposing of the high-strength wastewater that is produced. Although there are significant challenges, these create opportunities for innovation in the industry. © 2015 CSIRO.},

Drawing on recent technological progress and policy innovations, a comprehensive policy to address the region's water problems in the long run is offered. The policy has a dual goal: to satisfy the needs of a growing population (domestic, irrigation and industry) and to preserve important environmental amenities, including restoration of the Lower Jordan River and stabilization of the Dead Sea level. The gap between natural water supplies and the basic needs of the growing population will be closed by conservation and desalination; at the same time, all domestic water will be recycled and will be available for reuse in irrigation and environmental restoration. Over time the supply of recycled water that should be allocated for environmental restoration (accounting for the compensation of irrigators) will suffice to partially restore the Lower Jordan River and contribute to the stabilization of the Dead Sea. The analysis is relevant in a wide range of real-world situations, where satisfying the basic needs of a growing population and preserving environmental amenities become critical. © IWA Publishing 2015.},

	abstract = {Much of England is seriously water stressed and future droughts will present major challenges to the water industry if socially and economically damaging supply restrictions are to be avoided. Demand management is seen as a key mechanism for alleviating water stress, yet there are no truly effective incentives to encourage widespread adoption of the behavioural and technological demand management practices available. Water pricing could promote conservation, but on its own it is an inefficient tool for dealing with short term restriction in water supply. Raising prices over the short term in response to a drought is likely to be ineffectual in lowering demand sufficiently; conversely, maintaining high prices over the long term implies costs to the consumer which are needlessly high most of the time. We propose a system for developing resilience to drought in highly water stressed areas, based on a cap and trade (C\&T) model. The system would represent a significant innovation in England's water market. However, international experience shows that C\&T is successful in other sectors, and need not be overly complex. Here, we open the debate on how a C\&T system might work in England. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

FREEWAT aims at promoting water resource management by simplifying the application of the Water Framework Directive and other EU water related Directives. Specific objectives of the FREEWAT project are: to coordinate previous EU and national funded research to integrate existing software modules for water management in a single environment into the GIS based FREEWAT; to support the FREEWAT application in an innovative participatory approach gathering technical staff and relevant stakeholders (in primis policy and decision makers) in designing scenarios for the proper application of water policies. The open source characteristics of the platform allow to consider this an initiative "ad includendum" (looking for inclusion of other entities), as further research institutions, private developers etc. may contribute to the platform development. Through creating a common environment among water research/professionals, policy makers and implementers, FREEWAT main impact will be on enhancing science- and participatory approach and evidence-based decision making in water resource management, hence producing relevant and appropriate outcomes for policy implementation. The Consortium is constituted by partners from various water sectors from 10 EU countries, plus Turkey and Ukraine. Synergies with the UNESCO HOPE initiative on free and open source software in water management greatly boost the value of the project.

Despite the fact that the results of various GCMs are still heterogeneous, it is common to utilize GCM values directly in climate change impact assessment models. To mitigate these limitations, this study provides an alternative methodology, which uses GCM-based data to assign weights on historical scenarios rather than to directly input their values into the assessment models, thereby reducing the uncertainty involved in the direct use of GCMs. Therefore, the real innovation of this study is placed on the use of a new probability weighting scheme with multiple GCMs rather than on the direct input of GCM-driven data. Applied to make future projections of the water shortage in the Han River basin of Korea, the proposed methodology produced conservative but realistic projection results (15\% increase) compared to the existing methodologies, which projected a dramatic increase (144\%) in water shortage over 10 years. As a result, it was anticipated that the amount of water shortages in the Han River basin would gradually increase in the next 90 years, including a 57\% increase in the 2080s. © 2015 by the authors.},

On the basis of the recent work undertaken by OECD in this area, we identify and discuss three main dimensions for a comprehensive adaptation strategy for agricultural water management: i) creating an enabling environment to foster on-farm adaptive capacities through policies targeted at innovation, education, and advisory and extension services; ii) improving agricultural water management through the development of flexible and robust instruments, such as water pricing and water markets, to deal with both short-run water shortages and long-run water stress; iii) developing and improving risk management tools for droughts and floods to ensure that the true cost of risks is signalled to farmers while at the same time improving the efficiency of risk allocation.

The present paper utilizes an agent-based model of the complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory for the dynamic simulation of four water resource utilization plans and was able to forecast the per capita food share, per capita income and water security rate under three climatic conditions in Heilongjiang Province, China, in 2020. The forecasts were performed under the broad principle of coordinated regional development and based on Heilongjiang's food production, water resources and population data 2003-2010. The measured data for Heilongjiang Province in 2011 were used to perform joint risk analyses of the forecast results. The results showed that the comprehensive plan combining technological innovation and policy control provides the best method of achieving food security under the three climatic conditions. However, compared to maintaining the status quo, this combination plan decreases by approximately 8 \% under the three climatic conditions, but the per capita share of food and the rate of water security increase to over 10 and 20 \%, respectively. Therefore, to further reduce the pressure on water resources in Heilongjiang Province and to lessen the impact of climate on food production, advanced technology and policy regulations should be increasingly integrated into various industries to ensure the sustainable supply of regional water resources for food production. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.},

	abstract = {Water infrastructure is essential for the functioning of modern cities. This paper analyses conventional models of water infrastructure provision and emerging alternatives in order to identify points of reform and resistance in the relationship between people, technology and water in cities. It begins with a review of recent academic contributions to understanding the relationships between people, technology and nature in cities through the analysis of urban infrastructure. The work of Andrew Feenberg, a critical philosopher of technology, is presented as the basis for analysing both the technical and discursive elements of infrastructure. Feenberg's concept of 'the technical code' is used to synthesise key insights from the analysis of urban infrastructure and technology, to devise a series of critical categories for comparing changes currently underway in urban water infrastructure provision. This 'technical discourse of water infrastructure' is used to analyse developments in desalination, wastewater reuse, decentralised non-potable supply, domestic water efficiency, water sensitive urban design and ecological sanitation. Planners, designers and policy makers concerned about sustainability should be wary of the technical inevitability of desalination, potable recycling and other systems which reinstate conventional codes of domination and control of nature and separation of public concern from technical rationality. Decentralised water systems embody assumptions about the limits to water resources, but can also be problematic as high users of energy and reinforcing a private right to water. Improving the efficiency of domestic water using technologies and appliances is unarguably important in achieving sustainability. Moving beyond water efficiency to open up discussions about water using practices and cultural norms holds greater potential for transforming water consumption. Water Sensitive Urban Design is widely championed by designers and planners as exemplifying a sustainable approach to urban nature, providing a useful foundation for moving beyond drainage into water supply and wastewater technology and discourse. Ecological sanitation is filling a basic necessity in developing cities and may be part of a longer term transition to sustainability in developed cities in the future. Eliminating water from sanitation and recovering resources from waste holds the potential to radically reorder relationships between bodies, urban spaces and nature. Relationships between cities, technologies and water are shifting. The extent to which this balance falls in favour of sustainability over coming decades will be determined by political discourse as well as technical innovation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {For optimal, cost-saving management of irrigation water, precise knowledge is required of the overall water consumption made by the different species and varieties of plants existing in the area, under different conditions of climate, soil, etc. The most accurate way to determine this water consumption is by using weighing lysimeters. Unfortunately, because of current high costs, very few lysimetric stations are used in crop management to reveal real water consumption. Hence the need to develop new, low-cost lysimeters which make lysimetric stations available at an affordable price, and thus contribute to improve the management of water resources. This paper describes the development of a new, low-cost lysimeter, and its technical and economic valuation through the implementation of a 16-unit lysimetric station applied to analyse water consumption in potted plants. The system has been verified as highly accurate, easy to set up, and capable of filtering and storing data in real time, as well as controlling the electrovalves devised to open or close the tank where water drained from the pots is stored. This new agromotic system offers countless possibilities to accurately determine water consumption of any given plant. Additionally, if we consider its economic sustainability, proven by a study carried out for this specific purpose, which shows a positive net present value of the project, with a probability of 99\%, it becomes a fascinating topic for research projects, as well as a highly recommended tool for crop productivity improvement. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Previous research has found that the implementation of new ideas and practices are impeded by many challenges such as low forecast skill, institutional obstacles, and political disincentives to innovation. To better understand barriers to forecast use at seasonal-to-interannual, decadal, or longer time scales, this paper evaluates a diffusion of innovations (DoI) framework to assess the adoption of hydroclimatic forecasts by water managers in the Northeast United States. Specifically, this paper seeks to understand how five innovation characteristics, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability, influence the rate of adoption. Methods used for this analysis include the distribution of a survey, interviews, and a literature review. Results indicated that while much attention has focused on institutional obstacles, in the Connecticut River Basin obstacles were related to characteristics of the forecasts themselves. Evaluation of the DoI makes clear that the challenges to forecast use are common to all innovations. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The discourse analysis used here shows that communicative action encouraged participants to re-examine the validity of the technical, experiential, and normative knowledge that legitimized their reasons for acting. This study brings to light the fact that, in the context of a business primarily oriented towards making a profit, committing to sustainable development does not only operate in technical terms; such a commitment also requires collective validation of the effectiveness of alternative farming practices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The coupling of physically-based models for surface and subsurface water flows is a recent concern. The study of their interactions is important both for water resource management and environmental studies. However, despite constant innovation, physically-based simulations of water flows are still time consuming. That is especially problematic for large and/or long-term studies, or to test a large range of parametrizations with an adjoint model. As the current trend in computing sciences is to increase the computational power with additional computational units, new model developments are expected to scale efficiently on parallel infrastructures. This paper describes a coupled surface-subsurface flow model that combines implicit and explicit time discretizations for the surface and subsurface dynamics, respectively. Despite that the surface flow has a faster dynamics than the subsurface flow, we are able to use a unique nearly-optimal time step for each submodel, hence improving the resources use. The surface model is discretized with an implicit control volume finite element method while the subsurface model is solved by means of an explicit discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The surface and subsurface models are coupled by weakly imposing the continuity of water pressure. By imposing a threshold on the influence coefficients of the control volume finite element method, we can prevent the occurrence of unphysical fluxes in anisotropic elements. The proposed coupling is shown to produce results similar to state-of-the-art models for four different test cases while achieving better strong and weak scalings on up to 192 processors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of water used for food production over the period 1998–2010 with a view to identifying pathways for achieving the national target of 580 million tons of grain output by 2020. The analysis was based on modelling of agricultural water use coupled with national and provincial statistics. The present situation was defined by (a) a slow declining trend in national precipitation and internally renewable water resources, (b) 12 out of the 13 so-called breadbasket provinces (which currently produce 74 \% of national grain output) already facing water shortages and increasing competition for water from non-agricultural sectors, (c) national crop water productivity (CWP) increases of 19.5 \% over the 13 years to 2010, and (d) a widening gap in CWP between breadbasket and non-breadbasket provinces. By 2020 an estimated 510 to 680 km3 of water will be required for food production depending upon future gains in CWP. A concern is that in many of the breadbasket provinces, recent CWP gains have already been substantial and additional large gains may prove difficult especially considering current environmental concerns related to agricultural intensification in China. That said, the historic efficiency gains give reason for optimism provided that there is continued investment in genetic improvement and innovation of farming systems. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.},

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as a data-driven approach, are widely and successfully used in the management of water resources, which includes river flow forecasts. However, not using a number of parameters that influence the flow of streams as an input to the network will significantly reduce the performance of the model. One of these parameters, especially in snow basins, is snow. Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is a common parameter in river flow modeling and is used to effect the snow in the models. This study attempts to introduce cumulative precipitation parameters (Cprecip) instead of SWE. Some basins lack the required SWE; therefore, the Cprecips are applied in order to cope with the changes in these basins. The results show that the Cprecip can be used to replace the SWE when the suitable changes occur according to the conditions of the studied basin. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Institutional design for water governance assumes the possibility of intentional introduction of policy innovations into the new contexts or amending existing institutions. Such institutional design has been common in the water sector and examples include participatory irrigation management, integrated water resources management plans and water privatization programmes. With increasing application of institutional design across various political, socio-economic and cultural settings, the importance of the context is increasingly accepted. The key question is therefore how to reconcile institutional design and contextual variability. Based on our research on the introduction of water user associations in parts of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, we conclude that a top-down institutional design implemented nation-wide and not involving multiple stakeholders and engaging their views, is doomed to failure. As an alternative, we offer interactive institutional design, which is based on collaborative approaches to institutional design and treats design as works of assemblage. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We provide an overview of the research and investments needed to enhance agriculture in the region, with a focus on technology and institutions, while describing opportunities for improving rainfed crop production. We discuss a range of water management practices in three river basins that were part of the Challenge Program on Water and Food research on Basin Development Challenges from 2009 to 2013. Our main message is that technical and institutional innovations in water management are required for creating and sustaining resilient agrarian communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Such innovations are best designed and implemented in consultations involving researchers, households, investors, and other participants with a management or regulatory responsibility. It is in this collaborative spirit that we introduce this Special Issue of Water Resources and Rural Development, in which several authors present results of studies on agricultural water management in the region, with recommendations for better planning and implementation of interventions to benefit smallholder farmers. © 2015.},

This paper looks at systems for improved community-based water supply and sanitation management in the Rural Village Water Resources Management Project (RVWRMP), in mid and far west Nepal. The paper analysed 496 rural, community-managed drinking water and sanitation schemes (with 30 to 250 beneficiary households per scheme) supported by RVWRMP (2006–2014). Observed results are: 91.5\% fully functional, 8.3\% partially functional and 0.2\% of schemes closed due to natural disasters and social conflicts. This compares very favourably to the systems implemented by the government of similar age. We consider that the experience gained in RVWRMP provides relevant lessons on how to safeguard the functionality of rural water services infrastructure systems. The key elements noted by our staff are: prioritisation of the schemes by the community; application of quality implementation and user committee management; Water Safety Plans and active maintenance; and hands-on technical support and monitoring. © IWA Publishing 2015.},

	abstract = {The overall goal of this paper is to analyze the impacts of the urbanization on regional and national agricultural production through its impact on water use in agriculture in China. Given the historical trend of water use in agriculture and its correlation with urbanization, the change in agricultural water use due to urbanization is estimated. Then the impacts of this change on regional crop production are simulated based on the China Water Simulation Model (CWSM). Within CWSM, a positive mathematical programming (PMP) optimizes water allocation among crops and between irrigated and rainfed areas within a crop in each of ten river basins in China. The results show that water use in China has an obvious increasing trend, particularly in the industrial and domestic sectors, while the share of water use in agricultural sector has been dropping. A 1-percentage-point increase in urbanization can result in a 0.47 percentage-point decline in share of water use. Based on the model simulation, this will lead to the further decrease of irrigated areas and the increase of rainfed areas at both the national and river basin levels, particularly for water intensive crops (such as rice and wheat). Accordingly, average yields and total production will also decrease. A river basin with large production of either rice or wheat (or both) decreases more in irrigated area as urban area expands. Adaptation measures are recommended for both authorities and farmers to ensure food security, such as providing incentive for farmers to adopt water saving technology, implementing appropriate institutional and policy innovations (e.g., water use association, water pricing and water use rights). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper focuses on the state of water-conservation behavior and water education in China to assess how education, particularly the 9-year compulsory education program, affects water-conservation behavior. A survey (237 participants) was conducted in Guangzhou, the third largest city in China, to determine the attitudes of citizens towards conserving water. Overall, the following observations were made: (1) although 95 \% of the participants were aware of water conservation, only 42 \% recognized that it is urgently needed; (2) water-conservation actions lag behind water-conservation awareness, and only 19 \% of the participants were willing to perform more than five actions, including daily water reuse and conservation, whereas 48 \% of the participants performed less than two actions; (3) additional education will result in improved water-conservation behavior; (4) more than half of the participants who had graduated from primary and secondary schools showed poor water-conservation behavior; and (5) water-conservation education in the 9-year compulsory education program was extremely rare (representing 0.2–1.4 \% of the curriculum) and only included in four compulsory courses. From these observations, it was concluded that water education seriously lags behind the economic development of Guangzhou. Water and environmental education should be emphasized in the 9-year compulsory education curriculum because this program has a relatively large number of students in China. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Water governance has emerged as a field of research endeavour in response to failures of current and historical management approaches to adequately address persistent decline in ecological health of many river catchments and pressures on associated communities. Attention to situational framing is a key aspect of emerging approaches to water governance research, including innovations that build capacity and confidence to experiment with approaches capable of transforming situations usefully framed as 'wicked'. Despite international investment in water governance research, a national research agenda on water governance was lacking in Australia in the late 2000s as were mechanisms to build the capacity of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and collaborative policy practice. Through a two-year Water Governance Research Initiative (WGRI), we designed and facilitated the development of a community of conversation between researchers concerned with the dynamics of human-ecological systems from the natural sciences, humanities, social sciences, policy, economics, law and philosophy. The WGRI was designed as a learning system, with the intention that it would provide opportunities for conversations, learning and reflection to emerge. In this paper we outline the starting conditions and design of the WGRI, critically reflect on new narratives that arose from this initiative, and evaluate its effectiveness as a boundary organisation that contributed to knowledge co-production in water governance. Our findings point to the importance of investment in institutions that can act as integrative and facilitative governance mechanisms, to build capacity to work with and between research, policy, local stakeholders and practitioners.},

	abstract = {Resource-intensive business plays a fundamental role in causing climate change through the emission of large amounts of GHGs (greenhouse gases), and, in turn, climate-induced physical changes affect companies. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and climate events (IPCC, 2012). Droughts represent a major challenge for energy and water businesses, in terms of both exacerbation of dry climates and increase in the number of territories that experience water shortage. On the basis of an analysis of the energy and utility companies operating in different continents, the objective of this empirical research is twofold: on the one hand, it examines how these companies perceive the changes in water availability induced by climate change (as well as the potential impacts on business); on the other hand, it analyses the corresponding measures that these companies adopt to cope with changes in hydrology and water resources driven by climate change. Data from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) provide valuable information about business climate-related responses of several of the world's largest firms. Our results show that, in the energy and water sectors, some adaptive measures are starting to be implemented to deal not only with the risks but also with the opportunities related to climate-induced physical changes, thus leading to interesting innovation. The paper concludes that anticipated positive effects could drive energy and utility companies towards a proactive stance to achieve a competitive advantage and trigger innovative trajectories. © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

	abstract = {The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires EU member states to produce and implement river basin management plans, which are to be designed and updated via participatory processes that inform, consult with, and actively involve all interested stakeholders. The assumption of the European Commission is that stakeholder participation, and institutional adaptation and procedural innovation to facilitate it, are essential to the effectiveness of river basin planning and, ultimately, the environmental impact of the Directive. We analyzed official documents and the WFD literature to compare implementation of the Directive in EU member states in the initial WFD planning phase (2000-2009). Examining the development of participatory approaches to river basin management planning, we consider the extent of transformation in EU water governance over the period. Employing a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach, we map the implementation "trajectories" of 13 member states, and then provide a detailed examination of shifts in river basin planning and participation in four member states (Germany, Sweden, Poland and France) to illustrate the diversity of institutional approaches observed. We identify a general tendency towards increased, yet circumscribed, stakeholder participation in river basin management in the member states examined, alongside clear continuities in terms of their respective pre-WFD institutional and procedural arrangements. Overall, the WFD has driven a highly uneven shift to river basin-level planning among the member states, and instigated a range of efforts to institutionalize stakeholder involvement-often through the establishment of advisory groups to bring organized stakeholders into the planning process. © 2016 by the authors.},

First, the results suggest that economic growth in SSA is driven mainly by water and labor. Capital and energy were found not to significantly drive economic growth. Second, technical change in SSA is scale-biased and factor augmenting; suggesting that efficiency of water withdrawals and labor use would lead to technological progress in SSA. Third, substitution possibilities between water and labor exist indicating that restrictions on water withdrawals would lead to labor intensiveness and vice versa. Finally, a more general insight from the study is that efficient use of water resources promotes technological innovation and hence, critical for sustainable development. © 2016},

This paper investigates the structural, institutional and political rigidities that affect the adoption of irrigation scheduling technologies in southern European countries and highlights the corresponding opportunities. The recent implementation of water pricing policies, as required under the European Water Framework Directive, could motivate farmers to invest in technologies for improving water management. A review of irrigation water prices in southern Europe found a large range of prices both within and between countries, from 0.054-0.645 €/m3 (Greece) to 0.23-1.50 €/m3 (France). However, inadequate monitoring infrastructure and a lack of political will to impose the new water prices are giving a mixed signal to farmers. An ageing and poorly trained farm population, small farm size and low level of farm investment also impede the uptake of irrigation technologies. Within this context, European-funded research needs to consider these constraints and pay closer attention to the conversion of knowledge and innovation into successful commercial products. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Despite decades of water reforms, Ghana’s struggle to achieve sustainable urban water system is deepened by complex interactions of multi-layered political, socio-economic and managerial characteristics, leaving a rationing system of water supply in major cities like Accra. Using a multi-level perspective framework, the paper examines the dynamics of urban water system transition through management reforms. The study showed how external pressure at the landscape level influenced policy direction within urban water regime through the implementation of neo-liberal economic policies, paving way for resistance and grassroots innovation at the niche level. The implementation of such policies in the reform process did little to help achieve the desired sustainable urban water system goals. The paper suggests a blend of public and private financing with support for grassroots to improve urban water system management. However, subsequent urban water policy reforms must be informed by knowledge of social, economic, and political realities rather than imported generic “best policies and practices” that often conflict with local realities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	volume = {17},
	issn = {15822559 (ISSN)},
	abstract = {Global demand for water resources is increasing at a staggering rate, indeed in just the last decades the rate of demand for water has doubled that of population growth. Agriculture remains the largest global consumer of water resources and accounts for around 70\% of all global freshwater withdrawals, the majority of which is used for irrigation. Climate change will exacerbate both the problem of water scarcity and increase the risk of water pollution as variations in precipitation and temperature patterns can have extreme knock-on effects to local hydro-geological cycles. Climate change threatens the already precarious situation of rural Mediterranean areas that are facing a forecasted increase in future demand for irrigated farmland. This paper concerns the adoption of innovations in the agricultural irrigation sector, specifically addressing this issue in a Mediterranean region, Campania, where the majority of agriculture is irrigated and highly dependent on water availability. In the Campania region there have been several initiatives/projects finalized at promoting irrigation advisory services to farmers in order to foster a more efficient use of water resources. Despite the wealth of scientific knowledge available, the diffusion of these innovative systems is still poor. The objectives of the paper are, therefore, to identify, firstly, the perception of climate change among farmers, if there are adaptive actions already in place, and, finally, to identify the barriers to the wider adoption of the advisory services available. Using a participatory approach, it is shown that the use of integrated tools, which direct farmers towards more sustainable irrigation practices and provide water authorities with support for irrigation scheduling, could help to bring the interests of water users (farmers) and water authorities more into line with one another and meet both economic and environmental sustainability goals. © 2016, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

	abstract = {Adaptive governance is an emergent phenomenon resulting from the interaction of locally driven collaborative efforts with a hierarchy of governmental regulation and management and is thought to be capable of navigating social-ecological change as society responds to the effects of climate change. The assertion of Native American water rights on highly developed water systems in North America has triggered governance innovations that resemble certain aspects of adaptive governance, and have emerged to accommodate the need for Indigenous water development and restoration of cultural and ecological resources. Similar innovations are observed in the assertion of Indigenous voices in Australia. This presents an opportunity to analyze the emergence of adaptive processes within complex legal systems. We explore the role of law in locally driven innovation in this context, concluding that any system of governance that requires greater flexibility will only be viewed as legitimate, and thus succeed, if attention is given not only to adaptive capacity, but also to aspects of good governance. Through examples of the assertion of Indigenous rights, we illustrate critical links between adaptive capacity in water management, good governance, and law. © 2016 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Rainfall and snowmelt are important ways to produce runoff in Boertala River. The characteristics of arid basin are large area and snowmelt in the surrounding mountains. But the water resource is the most important factor for socio-economic development especially in arid regions. Calculating the total water resources can provide reference for government in formulating strategies. The soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) model developed by National Resources Conversion Service (NRCS), Department of Agriculture, the United States of America is the most popular and widely applied for direct runoff estimation. This method is modified by accounting for the static portion of infiltration and the antecedent moisture. It has passed through a great deal of discussion among scientists and hydrologists. The model is based on the water balance equation, in which the curve number is derived from the tables given in the National Engineering Handbook for catchment characteristics, such as soil type, land use, hydrologic condition, and initial soil moisture condition. The variability of these components can cause the instability of model parameters. The method provides the relationship among rainfall depth, retention parameter, curve number, and initial abstraction. In practice, the variability of retention parameter and curve number is observed, as a result of seasonal and storm morphology changes. To describe this variability and assess the errors in the estimation of curve number, many statistical studies were performed. The aim of the paper was to assess the variability of retention parameter and contribute to a better understanding and estimation of retention parameter for its practical application in water resource management. Applications of the original SCS-CN model for runoff estimation without the calibration of retention parameter value tended to give inaccurate results in arid area. The existing universal rainfall-runoff model is widely used in humid areas of small watershed; but for arid and semi-arid large watershed, we need find the good method to improve the model. In this paper, we focus on Wenquan watershed in source regions of Boertala River, and analyze the change trend about the temperature, rainfall and runoff in nearly 50 years. This paper used the 16 m resolution remote sensing image from high-definition earth observation satellite "Gaofen-1", which provided the land use classification data for original SCS-CN model to determine the curve number. This paper used Landsat8 OLI 30 m resolution remote sensing image to inverse the land surface temperature and vegetation index. And the surface temperature/vegetation index (TS/VI) was used to inverse the soil moisture. Use the principle of soil moisture absorption balance to estimate the model's retention parameter. It is the innovation in this paper. Use the degree-day model to calculate the equivalent water of snowmelt. Precipitation may need to be revised as the sum of snowmelt and rainfall. At last we used both original model and modified model to simulate the runoff of the 18 rainfall events from March to October in 2013 so as to explore the suitable modified SCS-CN model to simulate the runoff for the large basin with the mixed supply of rainfall and snowmelt. Results showed that the improved model's simulation value was close to the original model very well. In the validation periods, their correlation coefficients were 0.66 and 038, respectively. And relative errors were 17\% and 27\%, respectively. It further demonstrated that we can use remote sensing to inverse the land surface parameters for SCS-CN model, and use modified algorithm of SCS-CN model parameters to improve the accuracy of the simulation results. Improved model's simulation results show that it has feasibility and practicability for Wenquan watershed. From the improved algorithm of SCS-CN model parameters, it is evident that there is still some room for the original SCS-CN model to be modified and replaced by other relationships for more reliable runoff estimation. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Question 59 of the 22nd ICID Congress, by addressing the two issues of ensuring food security and securing livelihoods in rural areas, is therefore particularly relevant within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) process led by the United Nations. What is firstly addressed under this question is how securing irrigation contributes to securing food, which is compulsory for securing the livelihood of rural populations. Many papers highlight the role which rural communities can play in the governance of water resource and hydraulic systems. Adequate use of so-called 'poor quality water' is presented as a development factor of rural areas, as well as considering multiple uses, which may help sustainability. Water needs for food production are increasing, while other uses must be better satisfied in spite of climate changes often resulting in a scarcer resource. It is therefore crucial to improve irrigation efficiency through innovation and development of water-saving methods and techniques. Inter-basin cooperation, either within a country or transboundary, also appears as a solution to cope with limited water resources or to resolve water conflicts. © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Because the relevant environmental damages were not incorporated into evaluating conventional water-use efficiency, this efficiency indicator was incapable of depicting the real comprehensive effects except economic outputs. The concept of environment-economy integrated efficiency for regional water use (WEEE) was raised along with its evaluation method based on a combination of DEA and Malmquist index. The WEEE of Henan province was then studied by using the data on water uses and related economic outputs and pollution discharges from 2001 to 2012. In contrast to a higher level economic efficiency, a lower level environmental efficiency had been witnessed for water uses of the province. To a large extent due to a poor environmental efficiency, the provincial WEEE was dragged down by about 2\% if compared to the sole economic efficiency. Meanwhile, the cities with WEEEs of inefficient DEA in the province had exhibited the problems of low efficient water uses and excessive pollutant discharges. The averaged input redundancy rate of water resource reached 18\% in 2012, and the extra emission rates of COD and NH3-N were about 49\% and 49.2\% respectively. An analysis of variations of the total factor productivity (TFP) indicated that the technical change index was the most influential factor, resulting in an annually averaged decline of 2\% in Henan's WEEE in the study period. Thus, it was recommended that more inputs need be made into technical innovations to realize water saving and water pollution control. The total volume control of water use should be enforced along with abatement of water pollutants. © 2016, Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences. All right reserved.},

For example, water utilization efficiency in the eastern coastal provinces is significantly higher than that of inland provinces. The pattern of spatial auto-correlation Moran's I index presents significant spatial auto-correlation and evident cluster tendencies in China's inter-provincial water utilization. Factors that contribute to water utilization efficiency include economic development, technological progress, and economic openness. Negative factors affecting water utilization efficiency arise from industrial structure, government interference, and water resources endowment. In addition, the price of water resources is insignificant. The improvement of water utilization efficiency is essential to sustainable economic development. To raise the utilization efficiency of water resources, China should focus on transforming its industrial restructure, advancing technological development, enhancing economic openness, and encouraging entrepreneurial innovations.

Our results reveal insights about the attitudes towards innovation among decision makers, and how perceptions at the level of individual managers might create disincentives for experimentation. Although managers reported feeling relatively unhindered organizationally, they also spend less time on innovation than they feel they should. The most frequently reported barriers to innovation included cost and financing; risk and risk aversion; and regulatory compliance.

	abstract = {Though an outstanding achievement for their time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps of the eastern Alaskan Arctic nonetheless contain significant errors, and in this paper we address one of them. Specifically, USGS maps of different scale made in the late 1950s alternate between Mt. Chamberlin and Mt. Isto as the tallest peak in the US Arctic. Given that many of the peaks here are close in height and covered with glaciers, recent climate change may also have changed their height and their order. We resolved these questions using fodar, a new airborne photogrammetric technique that utilizes structurefrom- motion (SfM) software and requires no ground control, and validated it using GPS measurements on the peaks as well as airborne lidar. Here we show that Mt. Chamberlin is currently the third tallest peak and that the order and elevations of the five tallest mountains in the US Arctic are Mt. Isto (2735.6 m), Mt. Hubley (2717.6 m), Mt. Chamberlin (2712.3 m), Mt. Michelson (2698.1 m), and an unnamed peak (2694.9 m); these heights are relative to the NAVD88 GEOID12A vertical datum. We find that it is indeed plausible that this ranking has changed over time and may continue to change as summit glaciers continue to shrink, though Mt. Isto will remain the highest under current climate trends. Mt. Isto is also over 100m taller than the highest peak in Arctic Canada, making it the highest peak in the North American Arctic. Fodar elevations compared to within a few centimeters of our ground-based GPS measurements of the peaks made a few days later and our complete validation assessment indicates a measurement uncertainty of better than -20 cm (95\% RMSE). By analyzing time series of fodar maps, we were able to detect topographic change on the centimeter level on these steep slopes, indicating that fodar can be used to measure mountain snow packs for water resource availability or avalanche danger, glacier volume change, and slope subsidence, as well as many other applications of benefit to society. Compared to lidar, the current state-of-the-art airborne topographic mapping, we found this SfM technique as accurate, more useful scientifically, and significantly less expensive, suggesting that fodar is a disruptive innovation that will enjoy widespread usage in the future. © Author(s) 2016.},

Nevertheless, billions face water-related challenges, varying from lack of water and sanitation services to hindrances on livelihoods and socio-economic activities. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognize the broad role that water has for development, and also call for the private sector to participate in solving these numerous development challenges. This study looks into the potential of frugal innovations as a means for the private sector to engage in water-related development challenges. Our findings, based on a case study and literature review, indicate that frugal innovations have potential in this front due to their focus on affordable, no-frills solutions. However, we also recognize pitfalls related to frugal innovations in the water sector. Although the innovations would, in principle, be sustainable, deficiencies related to scale and institutional structures may emerge. These deficiencies are linked to the importance of water in a variety of processes, both natural and manmade, as well as to the complexity of global production-consumption value chains. Increasing the innovations' sustainability impact requires broader acknowledgement of the underlying value chains and their diverse links with water.

The objective of these projects is to support urban water utilities in the development, implementation and maintenance of IAM plans. To guarantee the success of IAM planning, following the AWARE-P IAM methodology, utilities are required to: consider that the infrastructure has system behaviour and lifespan is indefinite and guarantee the full-alignment of IAM planning with organisation objectives. By analysing the strategic and tactical plans of participating utilities, the proposed methodology principles are discussed and supported. The main innovation results from the implementation of IAM planning are also presented and discussed, including the challenges of setting up an IAM process, together with the major benefits and drawbacks that come up when developing IAM plans.

The county's water supply is withdrawn from the North Oconee River, the Middle Oconee River and, during periods of low flow, from the Bear Creek Reservoir. Major improve?ments to the J.G. Beacham Plant were completed in 2009. For safety and security, a new ultraviolet (UV) disinfection system was added. The chlorine gas system was replaced with sodium hypochlorite generators, brine, and hypochlorite storage tanks. A new chemical feed system was installed. Filter underdrains were upgraded, allowing filters to operate at a higher rate, thus increasing plant treatment capacity from 28 mgd to 36 mgd. The addition of a two-story wing, housing the new UV system, restored the building's original orientation toward the rive. Along with the significant improve?ments to plant processes, the county took an innovative step and built the Bob M. Snipes Water Resources Center (WRC).

	abstract = {Eco-efficiency has been widely recognized during the last two decades as a suitable measure of a given system's progress towards a greener and sustainable development. It combines the economic welfare and the ecological impact of products or services throughout their lifecycle. The need for improving eco-efficiency leads to the development of appropriate metrics for measuring the performance of a given system and the identification of the most promising alternative solutions (eco-innovations). This paper briefly presents a methodological framework for the eco-efficiency assessment of water-use systems, using a life-cycle oriented approach and a set of selected eco-efficiency indicators. The environmental performance of the system is evaluated through the relevant midpoint environmental impact categories, while the economic performance is measured using the total value added to the system's final product due to water use. The proposed framework is applied to the textile industry in Biella, Italy. The analysis reveals that the major environmental problems of the textile industry in the region are freshwater resource depletion, as well as human toxicity and ecotoxicity (both aquatic and terrestrial). The identification of the environmentally weak stages of the system has led to the selection of alternative actions, which could upgrade the whole value chain and improve the overall eco-efficiency. Six innovative technologies are examined and two alternative technology scenarios are formulated. The first scenario focuses on resource efficiency, while the second one focuses on reducing the emissions to water. The results show that all technologies could potentially improve the majority of the environmental performance indicators of the system. However, the scenario towards pollution prevention and control has proven to be not economically viable due to the high investment cost required and the current economic conditions, while the implementation of the scenario towards resource efficiency requires additional economic incentives and governmental support in order to be considered feasible by the industrial stakeholders. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Evaluating China's rural water conservancy modernization level objectively and scientifically is very important. In this paper, an evaluation system of rural water conservancy modernization in China was established based on modernization theory: the first rural water conservancy modernization mainly to improve the ability of disaster prevention and reduction and the second water conservancy modernization mainly on how to realize the sustainable utilization of water resources. It puts forward the first and second rural water conservancy modernization evaluation index system. The first rural water conservancy modernization evaluation indexes were given priority to infrastructure, including 4 indexes such as dependable farmland, projects supporting, drinking water safety and disaster reduction. The secondary rural water conservancy modernization evaluation indexes were given priority to quality, efficiency, and good governance, a total of 17 indicators. Using weighted evaluation model and SAS statistical software to analyze the basic parameters of every province (municipality or autonomous region), such as land treatment,farmers inputs,technology input, irrigation benefit, water supply, water quality, pollution control, resource exploitation, wet land index, charging level, participation level, water right trade and management quality, the first rural and the second rural water conservancy modernization index of every province (municipality or autonomous region) in China were calculated respectively. Results showed that the development trend of China's first rural water conservancy modernization was similar with the development trend of the first modernization of China's economy and the world's economy, and the modernization level was promoted with the growth of the first economic modernization. The modern index of 13 provinces (municipalities or autonomous regions) such as Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang and others was higher than the national average index and the index of Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Tianjin was on the top levels in order, namely economy developed areas also had the high rural water conservancy modernization level; The modern index of 18 provinces (municipalities or autonomous regions) was lower than the national average and Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Qinghai had the lowest index in order. It showed that the underdeveloped areas also had the lower rural water conservancy modernization level. Although the economic levels of some developed provinces and cities in China were close to the first economy modernization level of developed countries, their rural water conservancy modernization levels were still lower than the modern economic development level, such as Guangdong, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, their economic modernization indexes were 84.0, 94.0, 95.0 and 97.0 respectively, but their rural water conservancy modernization indexes were 74.4, 85.0, 88.0 and 96.5 respectively. Unlike the first modernization, the second rural water conservancy modernization indexes showed a larger difference with economic levels. The second rural water conservancy modernization indexes of economic developed provinces and cities were lower than the economic second modernization indexes, for example the second rural water conservancy modernization indexes of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin were 47.5, 51.30 and 45.2 respectively, but their second modernization indexes were 78.0, 69.0 and 57.0 respectively. In addition to the economically developed cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, the second rural water conservancy modernization indexes of the rest provinces (municipalities or autonomous regions) were higher than the second economic modernization index. It showed the different development trend. The main reason may be that the rapid economic development exceeds consumption of water resources and causes environmental pollution. The path deviation of the second modernization in China's rural water conservancy reminds people to timely change ideas, implement water conservancy modernization accordingly with new industrialization, and carry on the institutional innovation in the first place. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {The availability of freshwater resources in soil and groundwater bodies in the southwestern part of The Netherlands is expected to decrease during the agricultural growing season because of an expected increase of freshwater demands and a changing climate. This expected shortage of fresh water might negatively affect agricultural production. To cope with this problem, three pilots were initiated aimed at increasing freshwater supply at farm-level. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the socio-economic factors that determine the wider use of the measures investigated in these pilots. Therefore, the results of a feasibility study and a survey about drought risks were compared. The survey indicates that respondents do not make distinction between a dry and extremely dry year in their estimation of the return period. The results of a feasibility study illustrate that confidence and the level of common understanding regarding the reliability of these innovative measures has increased amongst project participants since 2012. The survey respondents were less optimistic about the wider implementation of the investigated technologies. A reliable freshwater supply and supportive legislation are the most decisive socio-economic factors for a future investment in additional freshwater supply for farmers in this region. Both studies illustrate that the impact of additional freshwater supply on farm economics strongly depends on farm type and crop cultivation plan. These insights may support the wider use of these innovations and may help to improve agro-hydrological models. © 2016, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Irrigated agriculture in Mediterranean areas faces tremendous challenges because of its exposure to hydroclimatic variability, increasing competition for water from different sectors, and the possibility of a climatic change. In this context, efficient management of water resources emerges as a critical issue. This requires the adoption of technological innovations, investment in infrastructure, adequate institutional arrangements, and informed decision makers. To understand farmers’ perceptions and their implementation of climate change adaptation strategies with regards to water management, primary information was captured in the Limarí and Maule river basins in Chile. Farmers identified stressors for agriculture; climate change, droughts, and lack of water appeared as the most relevant stressors compared to others productive, economic, and institutional factors; revealing a rising relevance of climate related factors. While most producers perceived climate changes in recent years (92.9 \%), a significant proportion (61.1 \%) claim to have experienced drought, whereas only a fraction (31.9 \%) have implemented a strategy to deal with this situation. Identified actions were classified in four groups: investments for water accumulation, modernization of irrigation systems, rationalization of water use, and partnership activities. Using a multinomial logit model these strategies were related to socioeconomic and productive characteristics. Results show that gender and farm size are relevant for investments, implementation and improvement of irrigation systems. For all the strategies described, access to weather information was a relevant element. The study provides empirical evidence of a recent increase in the importance assigned to climate factors by producers and adaptation options that can be supported by agricultural policy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {By means of "going greener", "getting smarter" and "converging smart-green", an innovation-driven smart city could address the steps toward more sustainability and aim toward improved human well-being. A vertical greening means a vertical triumph of greenery in a high density urban area, in some ways it displays the level of smartness and greenness in a city. Researchers have suggested the use of vertical greening in urban areas to improve sustainability of the environment. However, conventional vertical greening is in open fields, unprotected, threatened by climate disasters, lacking in better controlled climate conditions and plant response-based circumstances. In addition are always the challenges of energy saving, reduction of CO2 emissions, reduction in water use and in pesticide use. A greenhouse system could instead solve different facets of these problems in conventional vertical greening to achieve an optimal balance between an efficient environmental control and efficient plant use of available resources. The greenhouse solution appears to be intellectually justifiable, adaptable and innovative, and appears beneficial to a smart-green and sustainable smart city. Through the literature review and foresighted design point of view, the paper first summarizes the major concepts and trends of smart cities, vertical greening usage and new greenhouse technologies, and approaches an introduction to the relationship and development between vertical greening and greenhouse systems, and is followed by a presentation of a proposed novel prototype of a green-energy, water-autonomous greenhouse system. The sophisticated and multi-disciplinary greenhouse system reveals its innovations and advantages by using water resources and solar energy in a rational way, fit for an alternative-technology approach towards sustainable smart-green vertical greening in smart cities. Aimed at improving responsiveness, efficiency and performance for environmental and resource sustainability, and also aimed at improving well-being, the system is expected to be a foresight with simplicity in evolutionary vertical greening. By means of Industry Foundation Classes file format, with a true BIM model consisting of a digital prototype of the physical elements, further design of the system will allow us to simulate an ideal greenhouse type of vertical greening and understand its behavior in both the computer environment and actual on-site construction, as well as allow the building of a smart-green point cloud with BIM workflow on any network in a smart city. © SPSD Press, Kanazawa.},

Following a period of expansion in irrigation, an administrative moratorium was declared on new irrigated areas in 2005. Since then, the main policy measure has been aimed at the modernisation of irrigated agriculture and the implementation of water conservation technologies. The analysis carried out in this paper shows a significant increase in mean irrigation water productivity in the pre-moratorium period (1989-2005), driven by the creation of new irrigated areas devoted to high value crops and with a dominant use of deficit irrigation strategies, while a second phase (2005-2012) is characterised by slower growth in terms of the mean productivity of irrigation water, primarily as a result of a significant reduction in water use per area. Findings show that productivity gains seem to have reached a ceiling in this river basin, since technological innovations (such as new crops, deficit irrigation, and water-saving and conservation technologies) have reached the limits of their capacity to create new value. © 2017 by the authors.},

To meet such water security challenges, policy makers need to evaluate water use efficiency at the regional or basin level because the prosperity of city agglomerations is indispensable to the sustainable development of the region or basin.

Based on the distance between actual water use efficiency and the ideal efficiency, it calculates the potential reduction space of water input and pollutants by slack adjustment. Added to the Malmquist index, it forms a non-radial Malmquist water use performance index, which can be divided into technological change and technical efficiency change, to measure dynamic water use efficiency. Further, water use efficiency change is analyzed from the perspectives of technological improvement and institutional construction. Bohai Bay city agglomeration, a typical water-deficient city agglomeration in China, is taken as a case study, and data on water resource, environment, and economy from 2011 to 2014 have been used. In conclusion, there is much space for water use efficiency improvement on the whole. However, even having considered potential reduction space of water input and pollutant discharge under current environmental production technology, it is still not enough to support the city agglomeration's sustainable development. To relieve current potential water safety hazards, not only technical improvement but also institution innovation for highly efficient water use should be kept accelerating in Bohai Bay region. In terms of urban water management in developing countries, the research conclusion is of theoretical and practical significance. © 2017 by the authors.},

This research aims to evaluate the performance of quartz sand biofiltration for removing total suspended solids, turbidity, color, organic matter, and ammonium from polluted river water and develop an empirical model for designing quartz sand biofilters for the treatment of polluted river water. Experiments were conducted using two biofilter units filled with quartz sand as filter media. A set of experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of hydraulic retention time on biofilter performance in removing water contaminants. The kinetics of organic matter removal were also determined to describe the performance of the biofilter. The results show that biofiltration can significantly remove river water pollutants. Removal efficiency depends on the applied hydraulic retention time. At a hydraulic retention time of two hours, removal efficiencies of total organics, ammonium and total suspended solids were up to 78\%, 82\%, and 91\%, respectively.

Alternatively, advanced anaerobic technologies are implemented. The current study reviews different potential anaerobic schemes, factors influencing their final performance and optimum combinations of operational/design parameters. Anaerobic membrane bioreactors, upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors, expanded granular sludge beds, anaerobic hybrid reactors and inverse fluidized bed reactors are discussed. Their major advantages include: low energy requirements, energy recovery through biogas generation and high organic load removal. pH = 7, operation in a mesophilic environment and a hydraulic retention time long enough to enable anaerobic digestion in economically accepted reactor volumes are conditions that optimize the performance of anaerobic configurations. The evaluation additionally considers environmental aspects. The life cycle assessment of anaerobic industrial wastewater treatment reveals its positive environmental effect in terms of greenhouse gases emissions. Methane (a greenhouse gas) primarily contained in the biogas, despite being produced during anaerobic digestion, is utilized for energy production (heating, electricity) instead of being emitted to the atmosphere. Finally, anaerobic wastewater treatment is analyzed as part of the European Commission Innovation Deal that aims at converting conventional wastewater treatment plants to water resource recovery facilities able to combine sustainable wastewater treatment and water reuse.

	abstract = {Will Florida's agriculture adapt to climate change? Climate disruptions to agriculture and natural resources in Florida are projected to increase in the future. These impacts will be increasingly negative because critical thresholds are being exceeded. This chapter discusses how Florida's agriculture and natural resources may be affected by climate change in the coming decades. Agriculture will be affected by invasive alien species, sea-level-rise flooding, and storm surges. A warmer, drier climate will place agriculture in competition with other users for limited water resources. A serious concern for agriculture is that rising sea level will cause coastal groundwater to become more saline and groundwater levels to rise. The loss of coastal wetlands increases the risk of catastrophic damage due to extreme weather events. Degradation of soil and water assets due to increasing extremes in precipitation will challenge both rainfed and irrigated agriculture without the implementation of innovative conservation methods. High night-time temperatures can reduce grain yields and animal-sourced production. Climate change also increases the vulnerability of forests to ecosystem changes due to decreased soil moisture and increased evapotranspiration. The practical implications are that increased innovation will be needed to ensure the adaptation of agriculture and the associated socioeconomic system can keep pace with climate change. Given the difficulties in predicting our future climate, we must develop new risk-transfer innovations that will facilitate damage recovery. Changes in agricultural yields and food prices could have important implications for food security. Copyright © 2017 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The value of water resources and bodies has been acknowledged in terms of environmental, ecological, and landscape vision and sight because water itself is closely interrelated to the existence and expansion of humanity. The eco-design and eco-innovation of rural-housing in reservoir environment with sustainable tourism and mass-tourism development are under rising pressure of prohibited housings sprawls, human movement and entertaining and tourist consciousness starting from the end of the 21st century in Spain. In rapid urban/rural development and water resources and bodies maintenance, the conflict and struggle are required to be straightforwardly suggested in these such areas. This paper, therefore, describes a combined operational eco-design and eco-innovation plausibility of a participatory multi-criteria analysis (MCA) method for a rural-housing development in a case study reservoir area under tourism and mass-tourism. A case study executing this method was implemented in the Alange municipality with a reservoir of Badajoz region, Spain. Accordingly, this study explores priority criteria investigating the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and supporting opportunities of environmental conservation and economic growth as well which strongly emphasize benefits to the local community and effective management of tourism and mass-tourism. To reach a consensus criteria weight, a web survey to local residents and group discussion with a panel of experts are conducted for an analytical procedure. Then, it evaluates the suitability of the study area in order to optimally eco-design and eco-innovation of rural-housing based on the criteria with the aid of simple additive weighting (SAW) operator functions. This work classifies the particular attention and comparison for public participants in the analyzed map and in the valuation of the water visibility. The results measured and analyzed propose an innovative empirical and valued management method to assess the contemporary environment and infrastructure, and to predict their future developments, which could be applied to other situations and destinations. Particularly, this model analysis suggests a reason and confidence in a methodological approach to enhance the participatory thoughts and attitudes of public participants in the sustainable assessment management in reservoir environment under tourism and mass-tourism. Hence, this tool plans an approach to eco-design and eco-innovation of rural-housing development with the main objective of rising the reservoir environment’s quality of life for residents and the visitors’ satisfaction. © 2017, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

	abstract = {The ElectroKinetic Remediation Technology (EKRT), when applied to an earthy matrix, is generally targeted to the extraction of one or more pollutants, often inorganic and typically belonging to the category of heavy metals. The technique exploits the effects caused by the application of an electric field for allowing the mobilization of the targeted pollutants, whose displacement is often facilitated by the use of suitable chemicals, which act as complexing agents. The EKRT represents a very promising approach, as it is able to produce results comparable to those of other on/off-site interventions, though with appreciably higher levels of acceptability. Moreover, in spite of expectations (which are substantially based on the high use of energy and consumables), we showed that, once properly configured, the EKRT may represent an excellent choice even when judged based on the environmental sustainability. With the present study, we aim at discussing further the plant configuration, with a special focus on the water management. In fact, as anticipated in our previous communications, the modifications that we implemented in our EKRT approach allow presenting it as an electrochemically-assisted soil flushing. Several are the elements of innovation introduced, which proved to increase the effectiveness of the remediation, but at the price of a potentially very high water (and energy) consumption. It is therefore important to have an advanced water management system, preferably coupled with a reliable wastewater recovery system in order to avoid the waste of water resources, and consequently keep down costs as well as the ecological footprint related with the implementation of this technology, thus maximizing its benefits. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

We analyze characteristics of water governance at the municipal scale in Oklahoma, USA. ArcMap 10.3 was used to build a qualitative geographic information system (GIS) based on fieldwork, including interviews and site-observations, to compare dynamic capabilities that lead to innovation in 38 cities in the state. The GIS enables visualization of our digitalized research to understand the interconnections between drivers of innovativeness—the combination of dynamic capabilities and innovation rates—and state of water resource infrastructure in place specific and regional planning contexts. In particular, the GIS takes into consideration income level, the influence of state-level water policy (Water for 2060 Act), water manager certification levels, population, dynamic capabilities, and perceptions of risk and vulnerability to water system change. Digitizing this information provides a diverging perspective on the historical lack of innovation in the public sector, as different socio-cultural, socio-economic, and socio-political contexts occur throughout Oklahoma, a state notorious for its oil centered economy and its climate change deniers. The findings suggest that innovativeness is directly related to dynamic capabilities and indirectly related to population size, income level, and the educational backgrounds of water decision-makers. The visualizations also show that some cities have surplus capacity for adaptation, while others were able to more efficiently turn capacity into water management innovations. Seeing representations of water governance success and failure in communities affords the opportunity to educate citizens and decision-makers to adapt water infrastructures to the effects of climate change, showcasing the utility of digitalization in a quest for sustainable solutions. © 2016, The Author(s).},

Using Tianjin, a National Water-Saving City in China, as a case study, we adopted the refined Laspeyres and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index models to decompose the driving forces of industrial water use changes. The decomposition results of both models show that output and technology have long-term, stable effects on industrial water use in Tianjin. Output stimulates water use, leading to an average annual growth of 7700 × 104 m3, while technology inhibits water use, with an average annual reduction of 7900 × 104 m3. However, the effects of structure on industrial water use are not stable. During the study period, the stimulation and inhibition of industrial water use alternated; however, stimulation was dominant after 2008, implying increased partiality of the industrial structure toward high water use. The results of the study contrasted the hypothesis that Tianjin's primary goal in restructuring local industries over the past decade has been the achievement of water use efficiency.

	abstract = {Waterlogging is one of the major water issues in most cities of China and directly restricts their urbanization processes. The construction of Sponge City is an effective approach to solving the urban water issues, particularly for the waterlogging. In this study, both the urban issues emerged at the stage of rapid urbanization in China and the demands as well as problems of Sponge City construction related with the water issues were investigated, and the opportunities and challenges for the Sponge City construction in the future were also proposed. It was found that the current stormwater management focused on the construction of gray infrastructures (e.g., drainage network and water tank) based on the fast discharge idea, which was costly and hard to catch up with the rapid expansion of city and its impervious surface, while green infrastructures (e.g., river, lake and wetland) were ignored. Moreover, the current construction of Sponge City was still limited to low impacted development (LID) approach which was concentrated on source control measures without consideration of the critical functions of surrounding landscapes (i.e., mountain, river, wetland, forest, farmland and lake), while application of the integrated urban water system approach and its supported technologies including municipal engineering, urban hydrology, environmental science, social science and ecoscape were relatively weak and needed to be improved. Besides, the lack of special Sponge City plan and demonstration area was also a considerable problem. In this paper, some perspectives on Good Sponge City Construction were proposed such as the point that idea of urban plan and construction should conform to the integral and systematic view of sustainable urban development. Therefore, both the basic theoretical research and the basic infrastructure construction such as monitoring system, drainage facility and demonstration area should be strengthened, meanwhile, the reformation and innovation in the urban water management system and the education system should also be urgently performed. The study was expected to provide a deeper thinking for the current Sponge City construction in China and to give some of suggestions for the future directions to urban plan and construction, as well as urban hydrology discipline. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Groundwater is an increasingly important source of freshwater, especially where surface water resources are fully or over-allocated or becoming less reliable due to climate change. Groundwater reliance has created new challenges for sustainable management. This article examines how regional groundwater users coordinate and collaborate to manage shared groundwater resources, including attention to what drives collaboration. To identify and illustrate these facets, this article examines three geographically diverse cases of groundwater governance and management from the United States Sun Belt: Orange County Water District in southern California; Prescott Active Management Area in north-central Arizona; and the Central Florida Water Initiative in central Florida. These regions have different surface water laws, groundwater allocation and management laws and regulations, demographics, economics, topographies, and climate. These cases were selected because the Sun Belt faces similar pressures on groundwater due to historical and projected population growth and limited availability of usable surface water supplies. Collectively, they demonstrate groundwater governance trends in the United States, and illustrate distinctive features of regional groundwater management strategies. Our research shows how geophysical realities and state-level legislation have enabled and/or stimulated regions to develop groundwater management plans and strategies to address the specific issues associated with their groundwater resources. We find that litigation involvement and avoidance, along with the need to finance projects, are additional drivers of regional collaboration to manage groundwater. This case study underscores the importance of regionally coordinated and sustained efforts to address serious groundwater utilization challenges faced by the regions studied and around the world. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {A critical issue faced by the water industry is to efficiently manage limited water supplies to satisfy water demand from different sections (e.g., industrial, agricultural, energy and residential) and provide fresh and reliable sources of water for people's everyday life. Most existing research focuses on either water consumption planning (e.g., supply-demand balance) or water postconsumption planning (e.g., wastewater planning). It is expected to be more cost-effective to integrate the water consumption and postconsumption planning into a holistic model since they are highly interdependent. In this research, a closed-loop integrated water system including sources, water plants, end users, and wastewater systems is modeled using the network theory, and a robust planning decision model is developed to minimize the total system costs including operation costs (e.g., water production and distribution costs, and wastewater treatment costs) and penalty costs associated with directly emitting untreated wastewater to the environment. Various levels of uncertainties from both water demand and pipeline efficiencies are considered. Three sets of experiments are developed to test the effectiveness of the proposed decision model. The experimental results conclude that (1) the integrated decision approach can achieve more cost savings compared to separated decision processes for both the deterministic and stochastic scenarios; (2) the authors' proposed robust model can provide good balance between system robustness and cost; and (3) the integrated water system is more cost-effective when the water processing cost is dynamic, which highlights the benefits of the inventory and on-site third-party water plants. Analogous to the smart power-grid innovation, which employs on-site generation and storage systems to improve energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, the authors' proposed model demonstrates the benefits of using on-site inventory and third-party water plants to renovate the existing water infrastructure for more cost savings and reduced environmental impacts. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Research aimed at contributing to the further development of integrated water resources management needs to tackle complex challenges at the interface of nature and society. A case study in the Cuvelai-Etosha Basin in Namibia has shown how semi-arid conditions coinciding with high population density and urbanisation present a risk to people's livelihoods and ecosystem health. In order to increase water security and promote sustainable water management, there is a requirement for problem-oriented research approaches combined with a new way of thinking about water in order to generate evidence-based, adapted solutions. Transdisciplinary research in particular addresses this issue by focusing on the problems that arise when society interacts with nature. This article presents the implementation of a transdisciplinary research approach in the above-mentioned case study. The concept of social-ecological systems (SES) plays a key role in operationalising the transdisciplinary research process. Application of the SES concept helps to outline the problem by defining the epistemic object, as well as structure the research process itself in terms of formulating research questions and developing the research design. It is argued here that the SES concept is not merely useful, but also necessary for guiding transdisciplinary sustainability research and implementation. The study from Namibia clearly demonstrates that the introduction of technological innovations such as rainwater and floodwater harvesting plants requires a social-ecological perspective. In particular this means considering questions around knowledge, practices and institutions related to water resources management and includes various societal innovations alongside technologies on the agenda. © 2017 by the authors.},

However, under the influence of the environmental reform of the 1990s in Colombia, the institutional framework sought to avoid the threat by leaning towards the decentralized management of sustainability and the application of economic instruments such as the compensatory rate (Pigouvian tax). The purpose of this article is to review the performance of these two standards against the role of civil society in the intervention on water quality in the high basin of the Cauca river. For this, the institutional analysis combined with econometric tools including models with panel, ANOVA and finally main components are used. In the end, the scope of civic citizenship as a complement or alternative to the typical tools of the regionalized public administration is discussed. The results show, among many others, the harmlessness of financial instruments such as compensatory rates to attack water contamination, along with the capacity of social organizations to control associative processes in defense of the river water quality. © 2017 Universidad de Caldas.},

	doi = {10.1360/N972016-00753},
	abstract = {In this article, I try to answer the question-"Will Malthus continue to be wrong?", one of the 125 most challenging scientific questions raised by Science at its 125th anniversary ceremony, through a comprehensive review and analysis of historical backgrounds, population growth vs. economic development trajectories in recent decades, current new challenges, and future perspectives. Based on evidence from various theoretical and empirical studies in multiple fields, I conclude that Malthus' initial population theory is wrong in the past, present, and future. It has also been recognized that the new Malthusianism, which warned societies that quick population growth due to high fertility would put pressure on natural resources and the environment, and proposed birth control programs with voluntary contraception use, has made useful contributions to human development in the past decades. Given the fact that China's population has already entered the era of very slow growth and will decline in a dozen years, could we (as scientists) rest without worries about natural resources and environmental protections? Our answer is "No", because scientific research and policy analysis need to be strengthened to better understand the impacts of changes in the number and structure of family households on energy consumption, population aging, and sustainable development. Various studies have shown that household size has been shrinking in recent years, causing a quick increase in the number of households (including many living alone or empty-nest elders). Consequently, while the population growth rate is largely reduced and will become negative in a dozen years, energy consumption will substantially increase because households (rather than individuals) are the primary units of energy usage. Aside from energy use, plenty of research evidence suggests that older adults who live in small "empty-nest" households have significantly worse cognitive function, self-rated health, and life satisfaction compared to those elderly who live with or nearby their children and grandchildren. Empirical data analyses also show that three-generation co-residence or nearby living arrangements increase the workforce participation of female adult children and associated financial and health benefits, since grandparents traditionally take on care responsibilities for grandchildren. The analysis indicated that the old parents benefit more from emotional care provided by their adult daughters and sons-in-law compared to sons and daughters-in-law. To strengthen natural resource and environmental protections as well as to face the serious challenges of population aging, we propose that China needs to take two major policy actions. First, strongly enhance scientific and technical innovations in the fields of clean and efficient energy, emission reduction, protection of soil and water resources from pollution, and preservation of biodiversity. Second, implement a policy to promote three-generation co-residence or nearby living arrangements to reduce the negative effects of shrinking households on energy consumption, population aging, and sustainable development, More specifically, referring to successful policy programs that promote three-generation families in Singapore, we suggest that: (1) implement nationwide economic incentive policies to encourage adult children to live with (or nearby) their old parents; (2) encourage and support young migrants from the poor northwestern regions to go back to their hometowns to develop business and to reunite with their old parents, or bring their left-behind old parents to live with them in the cities; (3) encourage older parents to live with (or nearby) an adult daughter and son-in-law, even if they have both a son and a daughter. This would not only be beneficial for taking better care of old parents, but would also gradually change the tradition of daughters marrying out of their own families, which would help to eliminate son preference and reduce the high sex ratios at birth in China. In sum, the policy to encourage three-generation co-residence or nearby living arrangements is a win-win program that benefits both the elderly and their children, which is useful to address the serious challenges of population aging. It is also an effective way to slow down the quickly growing number of households and thus significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance environmental protection and sustainable development. © 2017, Science Press.

	abstract = {Green stormwater infrastructure has been demonstrated as an innovative water resources management approach that addresses multiple challenges facing urban environments. However, there is little consensus on what policy strategies can be used to best incentivize green infrastructure adoption by private landowners. Game theory, an analysis framework that has historically been under-utilized within the context of stormwater management, is uniquely suited to address this policy question. We used a cooperative game theory framework to investigate the potential impacts of different policy strategies used to incentivize green infrastructure installation. The results indicate that municipal regulation leads to the greatest reduction in pollutant loading. However, the choice of the “best” regulatory approach will depend on a variety of different factors including politics and financial considerations. Large, downstream agents have a disproportionate share of bargaining power. Results also reveal that policy impacts are highly dependent on agents' spatial position within the stormwater network, leading to important questions of social equity and environmental justice. © 2017.

At the same time, such a tool might support decision-makers in choosing strategies and actions aimed at forecasting, preventing, and mitigating environmental risks. A preliminary validation of the prototype performance was carried out in the field of water management, specifically for sample basin of Southern Italy. During the testing phase, this innovative application showed its ability to speed up field surveys, easily move around in unknown or remote places, and allow the employment of less-specialised users. These results could help reduce the time and costs of water monitoring activities, which would be perceived as essential by local administrators, contributing thus to the safeguard and the correct use of water resources. © 2017 by the authors.

	abstract = {Climate change is making water supply less predictable, even unreliable, in parts of the world. Urban water providers, especially in already arid areas, will need to diversify their water resources by switching to alternative sources and negotiating trading agreements to create more resilient and interdependent networks. The increasing complexity of these networks will likely require more operational electricity. The ability to document, visualize, and analyze water-energy relationships will be critical to future water planning, especially as data needed to conduct the analyses become increasingly available. We have developed a network model and decision-support tool, WESTNet, to perform these tasks. Herein, WESTNet was used to analyze a model of California's 2010 urban water network as well as the projected system for 2020 and 2030. Results for California's ten hydrologic regions show that the average number of water sources per utility and total electricity consumption for supplying water will increase in spite of decreasing per-capita water consumption. Electricity intensity (kWh m-3) will increase in arid regions of the state due to shifts to alternative water sources such as indirect potable water reuse, desalination, and water transfers. In wetter, typically less populated, regions, reduced water demand for electricity-intensive supplies will decrease the electricity intensity of the water supply mix, though total electricity consumption will increase due to urban population growth. The results of this study provide a baseline for comparing current and potential innovations to California's water system. The WESTNet tool can be applied to diverse water systems in any geographic region at a variety of scales to evaluate an array of network-dependent water-energy parameters. © 2017 The Author(s).

Regression models of water-year streamflow were constructed using historical naturalized flow data and a pool of 196 tree-ring (earlywood, latewood, and annual) ring-width chronologies from 76 sites. The tree-ring models accounted for up to 80\% of the interannual variability in historical naturalized flows. We developed a new algorithm for generating stochastic time series of weekly flows constrained by the statistical properties of both the historical record and proxy streamflow data, and by the necessary condition that weekly flows correlate between the end of a year and the start of the next. A second innovation, enabled by the density of our tree-ring network, is to derive the paleohydrology from an ensemble of 100 statistically significant reconstructions at each gauge. Using paleoclimatic data to generate long series of weekly flow estimates augments the short historical record with an expanded range of hydrologic variability, including sequences of wet and dry years of greater length and severity. This unique hydrometric time series will enable evaluation of the reliability of current water supply and management systems given the range of hydroclimatic variability and extremes contained in the stochastic paleohydrology. It also could inform evaluation of the uncertainty in climate model projections, given that internal hydroclimatic variability is the dominant source of uncertainty. © 2017.

	abstract = {North China Plain (NCP) is the main winter wheat and summer maize production area in china, grain production accounted for 10.6\% of the country. At the same time, NCP is one of the most serious groundwater over exploitation areas, in 13.92 million km2 of land area distributed Shijiazhuang, Baoding and Handan groundwater level drawdown funnel group, and the funnel area of more than 9700 km2. Agricultural mining accounted for more than 65\% of the total exploitation of NCP. In December of 2009, "scientific times" pointed out that the water resource in the NCP crisis of our country food security. Irrigation water and groundwater over-exploitation density is closely related to climate change. Climate change is not only affecting irrigation water, agricultural exploitation and groundwater recharge, but also groundwater field and groundwater ensure extent of well irrigation area, especially in continuous wet years or continuous dry years. So, It is of great significance to study the groundwater ensure extent in different climatic conditions. In this paper, aiming at the problems which the irrigation agriculture dependent and influence on groundwater is continuous rising, focus on further understanding groundwater ensure extent under climate change condition of next 30 years. Utilizing the methods of statistical analysis, penman formula, based on GCM predicted data of precipitation and air temperature data in 2011-2050, carried out the study of spatial and temporal characteristic and influence mechanism groundwater ensure extent, reveals the impact mechanism of agricultural activities on the groundwater flow field; Clary the temporal and spatial characteristics and the main controlling factors of the groundwater ensure extent. The main results as follows: (1) Climate change has significance influence on grain crop irrigation water requirement in NCP, and there is a great difference in different hydrological years. Reasonable utilization of this difference has great potential for water saving. In wet year, the main distribution area of winter wheat irrigation water demand index (IDI) was in between 0.6 and 0.7, and summer maize was in between 0.3 and 0.4, distribution area of the North China region accounted for 60.1\% and 41.5\%, respectively. In normal flow years, the main distribution area of winter wheat IDI was in between 0.7 and 0.8, and summer maize was in between 0.4 and 0.5, distribution area of the North China region accounted for 92.8\% and 76.1\%, respectively. Under dry years, the main distribution area of winter wheat IDI was in between 0.8 and 0.85, and the summer maize was in between 0.6 and 0.7, distribution area of the NCP accounted for 52.9\% and47.3\%, respectively. Comparing with historical period (1961-2015), there is great change of crop irrigation water demand in Scenarios in the future period (2016-2050). From historical period to scenarios future period, winter wheat irrigation water requirement was significantly decreased in Yanshan piedmont plain and Central Plains, the decline rate were 97.8 mm/10 years and 71 mm/10 years, coastal plain showed a significant upward trend, the IDI evolution trend is not obvious. Summer Maize irrigation water demand and IDI showed a significant upward trend in Yanshan piedmont plain, Taihang Piedmont and coastal plain regions, the increase rate of irrigation water demand is 15.5 mm/10 year, 13.7 mm/10 year and 34.9 mm/10 year respectively, and the IDI rate is 0.025/10 year, 0.015/10 years and 0.041/10 year. The Central Plains rising trend is not significant. (2) The amount of groundwater exploitation in the main grain producing areas of the NCP is closely related to precipitation and agricultural irrigation amount, and the response of different location to climate change is obvious difference. An increase of 100 mm for precipitation, the irrigation water and groundwater exploitation will decline 1.2 billion m3 and 0.9 billion m3, the precipitation equilibrium point 498 mm corresponding to crop irrigation water is 23.19 billion m3, groundwater exploitation is 38.56 billion m3 in piedmont plain. in central plain, the irrigation water and groundwater exploitation will decline 0.23 billion m3 and 0.13 billion m3, the precipitation equilibrium point 545 mm corresponding to crop irrigation water is 28.07 billion m3, groundwater exploitation is 24.39 billion m3.in coastal plain, the precipitation and crop irrigation water demand, groundwater exploitation also showed a close negative correlation relationship. The influence climate impact on groundwater level in different regions is obviously different, which is closely related to the regional hydrogeological conditions. In Shijiazhuang plain, an increase of 100 mm for crop irrigation water demand, the groundwater level change amplitude will incline 0.26 m. In Dezhou area, the groundwater level change amplitude will incline 0.36 m. In Cangzhou plain, the groundwater level change amplitude will incline 0.60 m. In the piedmont plain, in the combined climate conditions of wet-wet years, the groundwater level years will rebound sharply. In the combined climate conditions of normal flow-dry years, dry-dry year, the groundwater level years will significantly decline. In the Central Plains, under the combined climate conditions of normal flow-dry years, the groundwater level has the tendency of declining, in the combined condition of normal flow-normal flow year, the groundwater level can be recovered to the level of the beginning of the year. In the coastal plain, under the combined climate conditions of wet-wet years, the groundwater level was slightly downward trend, in the condition of normal flow-dry year, groundwater level will significantly decline. (3) Climate change has a great influence on groundwater ensure extent, and it is an important constraint for the rational exploitation of groundwater in irrigation agriculture. In wet years, the groundwater ensure extent of NCP is 81\%, is belong to higher extent. In normal flow year, the groundwater ensure extent is 54\%, is the state of basic ensure extent. In dry years, the groundwater ensure extent is 45\%, is under inferior state. From groundwater ensure extent occurrence probability situation analysis, higher extent situation occurrence probability was maximum, and the probability was 0.47 in piedmont plain, in central plains, inferior ensure extent situation occurrence probability was maximum, and the probability was 0.65; in coastal plain, basic ensure extent situation occurrence probability was maximum, and the probability was 0.59. In NCP scale, water resource carrying capacity is the driving factor of groundwater ensure extent. The grey correlation coefficient of groundwater ensure extent and region water resource modulus was 0.79, followed by precipitation, the grey correlation coefficient was 0.76. Form different location scale analysis, precipitation is the main driving factor, the effect intension in all partition of NCP was over 22\%.an increase 100 mm for precipitation, the groundwater ensure extent will increase 4.07\%, 6.41\%, 5.99\% and 5.41\% respectively, in Yanshan piedmont plain, Taihang piedmont plain, central plain, coastal plain. (4) Under the climate scenarios of RCP4.5, In Taihang Piedmont of North Henan plain, the groundwater ensure extent is in higher state, Yanshan Piedmont plain is under basic ensure extent, Taihang Mountain of Hebei Plain, Henan central plain and the coastal plain is in a state of inferior, and the Hebei central plain is under the state of difficult to ensure. From groundwater ensure extent occurrence probability situation analysis, the maximum probability of groundwater ensure extent will be basic ensure extent situation in Yanshan piedmont plain, and the probability value will 0.77. In Taihang piedmont plain, higher ensure extent situation occurrence probability will be maximum, and the probability will 0.90, but there will be great difference in region inside, in North of Henan Province of Taihang piedmont plain, higher ensure extent situation occurrence probability will 1, in central of Hebei province of Taihang piedmont plain, inferior ensure extent occurrence probability will be maximum. The maximum probability of groundwater ensure extent will be inferior ensure extent situation in central plain, and the probability value will be 0.6, in coastal plain, the probability value of inferior ensure extent will get 0.7. From history period to future scenario period, the groundwater ensure extent will be significantly rise in level of 1\%, and the rise rate is 3.3\%/10 year; there will be descend trend in Taihang piedmont plain, central plain, and coastal plain, and the descend rate will be 1.6\%/10 year, 0.2\%/10 year, 0.1\%/10 year. Innovation point: Prominent the mechanism research of climate change and agriculture exploitation impact on groundwater ensure extent. Based on the GCM predicted date in the period of 2016-2050, understanding the process, characteristics and law of groundwater evolution in NCP main grain producing area with the concept of system, utilizing the methods of dynamic viewpoint and nonlinear dynamic theory, compare to elects the suitable GCM of NCP, and downscale the key meteorological date, reveal groundwater ensure capacity spatial-temporal characteristics and mechanism in main grain producing areas of NCP under different climatic conditions, clarified the characteristics and development trends of groundwater ensure extent of different regions of NCP in different hydrological years, for the first time.

Despite this, sustainability principles and the importance of urban groundwater are lacking in future city visions. Using London as a case study, the importance of groundwater for cities is highlighted and a range of future city interventions may impact on groundwater are reviewed. Using data from water resource plans and city planning strategies, changes in the groundwater balance which may occur as a result of city interventions are calculated for two future city scenarios: a 'strategic’ future informed by organisational policy and an ‘aspirational’ future guided by sustainability principles. For London, under a strategic future, preferential investment in industry-scale technologies such as wastewater treatment and groundwater storage would occur. Acknowledgement that behaviour change offers the potential for a faster rate of transformation than innovation technologies is ignored. The capacity of community-led action and smart-home technologies to deliver sustainable water use under an aspirational future is evident, with a measurable impact on urban groundwater.

	abstract = {There is a growing recognition among water resource managers that sustainable watershed management needs to not only account for the diverse ways humans benefit from the environment, but also incorporate the impact of human actions on the natural system. Coupled natural-human system modeling through explicit modeling of both natural and human behavior can help reveal the reciprocal interactions and co-evolution of the natural and human systems. This study develops a spatially scalable, generalized agent-based modeling (ABM) framework consisting of a process-based semi-distributed hydrologic model (SWAT) and a decentralized water system model to simulate the impacts of water resource management decisions that affect the food-water-energy-environment (FWEE) nexus at a watershed scale. Agents within a river basin are geographically delineated based on both political and watershed boundaries and represent key stakeholders of ecosystem services. Agents decide about the priority across three primary water uses: Food production, hydropower generation and ecosystem health within their geographical domains. Agents interact with the environment (streamflow) through the SWAT model and interact with other agents through a parameter representing willingness to cooperate. The innovative two-way coupling between the water system model and SWAT enables this framework to fully explore the feedback of human decisions on the environmental dynamics and vice versa. To support non-technical stakeholder interactions, a web-based user interface has been developed that allows for role-play and participatory modeling. The generalized ABM framework is also tested in two key transboundary river basins, the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia and the Niger River basin in West Africa, where water uses for ecosystem health compete with growing human demands on food and energy resources. We present modeling results for crop production, energy generation and violation of eco-hydrological indicators at both the agent and basin-wide levels to shed light on holistic FWEE management policies in these two basins. © 2017 Author(s).},

This paper examines newspaper coverage of the most widely celebrated potable water reuse project in the world-the Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS) in Orange County, California, USA. The case study examines the coverage of GWRS contained in local, national, and international newspapers during an era of significant investment and repeated expansion. Despite the potential controversy associated with drinking recycled wastewater, there was no negative newspaper coverage of GWRS from 2000-2016. Much of the coverage was mundane, however several articles embraced infrastructure and technology as key to developing new water resources while protecting public and environmental health. Although potable water recycling is presented as an innovative solution capable of solving several problems at once, a close analysis reveals that recycled water may not fulfill the promise of an uninterruptible urban water supply. © 2017 by the author.},

	abstract = {In Hungary, alternative water resources utilization should take priority over the conventional irrigation water resources (surface and subsurface waters) in the future, similarly to the global trends because of the global warming and water scarcity. To preserve our most important renewable natural resource (soil), farmers and researchers are responsible for development of soil management practices and irrigation principles. Adaptation by farmers of this new, sustainable technologies soil degradation can be avoided, and the natural soil processes can be improved. Usage of different quality irrigation water was evaluated in our experiment measuring the variation of the soil exchangeable cations after one season of irrigations using wastewater in an energy willow plantation. The thermal water based wastewater, originated from an intensive catfish farm, was applied for micro-sprinkler irrigation in the Lysimeter Station of National Agricultural Research and Innovation Centre (NAIK), Research Department of Irrigation and Water Management (OVKI) in Szarvas, Hungary. According to our results the exchangeable sodium percentage (NaS\%) increased significantly in all wastewater treatments with +1.16-4.4\% after one year, and the sodium decreased significantly in the treatment with Körös River water irrigation with -0.26-1.1\%. There were no significant changes in the NaS\% when a diluted and improved (gypsum-added) wastewater was applied, and the soil's sodium content did not increase above 200 mg/kg. In addition, the willow yields depended on the available irrigation water amount and there was no significant impact of the irrigation water quality on it. The highest biomass yields (4480.8±435.8 g/m2) were achieved in treatments with 60 mm water per two weeks. The accumulated sodium in the willow stem was less than 1\% of the irrigation water sodium content, making the removal of this harmful element by willow harvest unsuitable. The results suggest that further wastewater irrigation usage might be sustainable with the diluted and improved quality water.},

In this study, monthly groundwater level time series of 322 observation wells in Sistan and Balouchestan province of Iran in the period 2002 to 2012 were used as a measure of sustainable development. Results show that 95.6\% of areas of the province aquifers are non-stationary.

Beyond water scarcity, several regions are already suffering from lack of access, even where water is abundant. Meanwhile, climate change, overpopulation and agricultural demand are severely affecting the quality and availability of water resources. At the global level, concerns about water are tied to the Amazon Region, which contains the greatest potential water stock in the world, and which simultaneously faces the worst troubles in access and supply. This paper is therefore aimed at pointing out the role inclusive social innovations can play in mitigating the impact of growing water shortages and securing effective water use. After a first introduction to Brazil, Amazonas and Parà state statistics on water-related aspects, the research focuses on results emerging from the AguaSociAL project. © 2018 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.},

	abstract = {As arid regions face increasing pressures on their water resources, the challenge of securing an adequate supply of good quality water to meet growing demands calls for innovative approaches that involve a diversification of water supply options and improved management of wastewater. Water recycling is a disruptive innovation that can help to achieve this goal in arid countries if the appropriate technical and institutional barriers are broken down. Within the water innovation literature, key questions remain as to the nature of the process and of the temporal dynamics of a shift towards decentralized wastewater infrastructure. This study offers insights into these mechanics using the Framework for Analyzing a Multi-level Innovation System (FAMIS), a cross-sectoral model that draws on the theories of technological innovation systems, system dynamics, transitions of socio-technical regimes, and evolutionary theories of technology. Cases from three water-scarce countries with distinct political economies—Australia, the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and Jordan—were used to document the dynamics of innovation in the water recycling system and identify policy solutions. Despite important contextual differences, in the three cases examined, actors and institutions have dynamically interacted to create a small niche where water recycling has emerged as a viable technology. Yet the application of the FAMIS model revealed that the dominant regime of water management has not been fundamentally altered due to blockages mainly at two “stages” of the FAMIS innovation lifecycle: the selection and adoption stages. We identified cross-geographical socio-technical and environmental characteristics and common mechanisms that strongly influence the evolution of water recycling technology through the innovation system. We find that the water-recycling technology evolves into the later stages of the innovation system in Australia, with the chokepoint occurring most importantly within the sophisticated but fragmented institutions that regulate water recycling. In the U.A.E., while agricultural reuse is widespread (to a larger extent than in Australia), major barriers occur earlier in the system, leaving mainly the water recycling technologies in the early stages of the system, where policy-induced path dependency block most selection mechanisms. With a wider infrastructural and institutional gap, Jordan may actually face less stringent barriers to water-recycling developments throughout all stages of the innovation system, namely influenced by international donors. Policy recommendations derived from this work to address barriers at the selection and adoption stages include favoring a coordinated institutional long-term vision and planning to overcome path dependence, enhancing social acceptance and adequate implementation of laws and regulations, and supporting data acquisition and model developments to build a stronger business case for water recycling. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Much of the developing world and areas of the developed world suffer water vulnerability. Engineering solutions enable technically efficient extraction and diversion of water towards areas of demand but, without rebalancing resource regeneration, can generate multiple adverse ecological and human consequences. The Banas River, Rajasthan (India), has been extensively developed for water diversion, particularly from the Bisalpur Dam from which water is appropriated by powerful urban constituencies dispossessing local people. Coincidentally, abandonment of traditional management, including groundwater recharge practices, is leading to increasingly receding and contaminated groundwater. This creates linked vulnerabilities for rural communities, irrigation schemes, urban users, dependent ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services that they provide, compounded by climate change and population growth. This paper addresses vulnerabilities created by fragmented policy measures between rural development, urban and irrigation water supply and downstream consequences for people and wildlife. Perpetuating narrowly technocentric approaches to resource exploitation is likely only to compound emerging problems. Alternatively, restoration or innovation of groundwater recharge practices, particularly in the upper catchment, can represent a proven, ecosystem-based approach to resource regeneration with linked beneficial socio-ecological benefits. Hybridising an ecosystem-based approach with engineered methods can simultaneously increase the security of rural livelihoods, piped urban and irrigation supplies, and the vitality of river ecosystems and their services to beneficiaries. A renewed policy focus on local-scale water recharge practices balancing water extraction technologies is consistent with emerging Rajasthani policies, particularly Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan (‘water self-reliance mission’). Policy reform emphasising recharge can contribute to water security and yield socio-economic outcomes through a systemic understanding of how the water system functions, and by connecting goals and budgets across multiple, currently fragmented policy areas. The underpinning principles of this necessary paradigm shift are proven and have wider geographic relevance, though context-specific research is required to underpin robust policy and practical implementation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Controlling groundwater diffuse pollution induced by agricultural practices remains a significant challenge and has been receiving strong attention in the European Union (EU) for the last 25 years. The EU's Nitrates Directive (91/676EC) and its associated Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) legislation were recently revised in France in 2015, requiring farmers to adopt measures and then modify their agricultural practices to protect water resources. Yet these measures are not always implemented in an optimal way, thus limiting improvement of groundwater quality. Based on semi-directive interviews with 14 French farmers, we developed an innovative farm-scale method composed of four steps. First, we described how these farmers implemented Nitrate Directive measures. Second, we evaluated their impact on farm structure and third their consistency with farmer's strategy. Fourth, we assessed their suitability for farm management as an integrative analysis of the previous step. Through this approach, we identified 3 types of farm management. A group of “Beyond Regulation” composed of farmers for whom Nitrate Directive measures are suitable for their farm management. They optimally implement these measures to reduce pressure on groundwater quality. For the second group named “Soft Regulation-constraints”, Nitrate Directive measures are less suitable for their farm management because they have another lucrative activity than cash crop production. This group could benefit from a redesign of the measures, changing from means- to result-oriented obligation in order to take into account the local conditions and also their farm management constraints. For the third group, denoted as “Strong Regulation-constraints”, ND measures are not suitable for their farm management. The way they implement measures is usually not optimal to reduce pressure on groundwater quality. We suggest that, investing in an “action-learning” program for such farmers could make them understand the usefulness of this regulation and help them to make the measure implementation suitable for their farm management. This farm-scale method could be used further for water management stakeholders to (i) evaluate the suitability of measures from Water Policy for the diversity of farm management or (ii) design suitable measures for the diversity of farm management on a territory subjected to groundwater pollution issue. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Constitutionality refers to a bottom-up institution building process based on the activation of emic perceptions of people who are often marginalized in policymaking, as well as on alliances with external actors, with the aim of achieving recognition by the state of self-created institutions. Results show that the constitutionality concept helps to link analysis of local people’s resistance movements against top-down water policies with an emerging process of institutional innovation that aims for more sustainable water governance. Local institutional innovations embody the principles of water justice; these are recognized by the state as being part of its own Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policy, and thus find their way into state policy arenas. This analysis provided the basis for the formulation of a conceptual framework that integrates water conflicts, water justice, and IWRM into the concept of constitutionality. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Current sanitation systems are inherently limited in their ability to address the new challenges for (waste)water management that arise from the rising demand to restore resource cycles. These challenges include removal of micropollutants, water (re)use, and nutrient recovery. New opportunities to address these challenges arise from new sanitation, a system innovation that combines elements of source separation, local treatment and reuse, and less use of water. New sanitation is applied, but not yet widespread, in several residential areas in Europe. Implementation is hindered by the lack of insight into the general public's willingness to engage in new sanitation, and the resulting uncertainty about this among decision makers and other stakeholders in wastewater management. Using value-belief-norm theory as a conceptual lens, this paper addresses the individual motivations (pro-environmental personal norms) and personal drivers (benefits) and barriers (risks) for acceptance of new sanitation by the Dutch general public. The results of an online survey (N = 338) indicated that both pro-environmental personal norms and risk and benefit perceptions predict consumers' willingness to accept new sanitation. More specifically, they showed that consumer acceptance is driven by perceived risks relating to the housing market and the need to change behavior, but also by environmental benefits. Overall, new sanitation was favorably evaluated by respondents: 64\% indicated that they would likely use new sanitation if they were owner-occupiers. The results of this explorative study are discussed in light of the development of novel sanitation systems that are sensitive to perceptions of end-users and other key stakeholders. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In a time of resource reduction and climate variability, water conservation is critical to improve agroecosystem sustainability. Non-ionic surfactants were recently hypothesized as irrigation adjuvants, but so far researchers obtained contrasting results. The first objective of this work was to evaluate the capillary adsorption properties of organosilicone surfactants by providing two robust tests on standard porous media. Results showed smaller capillary mobility and higher wetting power (“superspreading”) compared to pure water. An innovative non-ionic surfactant formulation, the organosilicone PET (PolyEther-modified Trisiloxane), was then investigated as irrigation adjuvant in a pot trial on lettuce in absence of fertilization. Overall, the system was characterized by an improvement in the processes of resource acquisition, i.e. water and nutrients. Results indicated higher lettuce leaf area, reduced root dry weight and root:shoot ratio and a positive main effect on the uptake, availability and/or use efficiency of P, K and some micronutrients. The N use efficiency and recovery increased 3–15\%, with higher N concentration and content against changes in plant weight. Fresh yield data showed a particularly high irrigation use efficiency (+77–60\%), and the adjuvant productivity (variation of lettuce yield due to PET) increased by 12–26\%. Our experimental findings can be explained by hypothesizing that PET affected both capillary and adsorption processes during water diffusion along concentration gradients, which constitute the main driving force for solutes movement towards the roots. A theoretical model is provided to explain how PET improved the thickening and interconnection of conductive adsorbed water film in soil. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The shrimp sector has been one of the fastest growing agri-food systems in the last decades, but its growth has entailed negative social and environmental impacts. Sustainable intensification will require innovation in multiple elements of the shrimp production system and its value chain. We use the case of the shrimp sector in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam to explore the constraints in the transition to sustainable intensification in shrimp farming, using an analytical framework based on innovation systems thinking, i.e., an aquaculture innovation systems framework. Using this framework, we conduct a systemic diagnostic of blocking mechanisms, interrelated sets of constraints within the aquaculture sector that hinder a transition toward sustainable intensification. Our findings show that the major constraints are institutional, with limited enforcement of the regulatory framework for input quality control, disease control, and wastewater management, and a lack of coordination between government bodies to design and enforce this framework. At farm level, limited access to capital favors pond mismanagement and the use of low-quality inputs. The absence of multi-stakeholder initiatives to foster dialog between actors in the value chain constrains the response to new regulations dictated by international market demand. Because of shrimp farming’s connectivity with the wider ecosystem, sustainable intensification in shrimp farming will require collective management of water resources at the landscape level for disease and water pollution control. Ecological principles for pond management need to be promoted to farmers in order to reduce farmers’ inefficient practices and build their capacity to understand new techniques and inputs available in the Vietnamese market. Our paper demonstrates for the utility of a multi-level, multi-dimension, and multi-stakeholder aquaculture innovation systems approach to analyze and address these blocking mechanisms in the transition to sustainable intensification in shrimp farming and aquaculture more broadly. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This paper is a reflexive analysis of a three-year participatory water research project conducted in the Upper East Region (UER) of Ghana, whose explicit objective was to initiate a multi-level dialogue to support the national Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policy framework. The transdisciplinary team adopted the Companion Modeling approach (ComMod), using role-playing games and a computerized agent-based model to support the identification of a problemshed centered on issues of river bank cultivation, erosion, and flooding, and initiate a multi-level dialogue on ways that this problemshed could be tackled. On the basis of this experience, we identify three key criteria for transdisciplinary research to support innovative water governance: (1) the iterative adaptation of tools and facilitation techniques based on feedback from participants; (2) a common understanding of the objectives pursued and the approach used among researchers, who need to explicit their posture, and crucially; (3) the co-identification of a problemshed that diverse stakeholders are interested in tackling. Finally, we argue that the context in which research is funded and conducted in the development sector constitutes a challenge for researchers to be "participants like any other" in the projects they coordinate, which constitutes a barrier to true transdisciplinarity. © 2018 by the authors.},

For the last several decades, seawater has become an important source of fresh water as it is one of the most abundant resources on earth. Desalination is the process of removal of salts from seawater and is postulated to be a core technology in alleviating this problem. Clathrate hydrate based desalination (HyDesal) is a potential technology for seawater desalination. Salts are excluded from hydrate formation, thereby resulting in solid hydrate and concentrated brine. After separation from brine, the solid hydrate crystals upon dissociation produce pure water. In this work, a detailed review of the literature (both patents and publications) so far on HyDesal is critically evaluated, and prospects and directions to commercialize the HyDesal process are presented. Further, innovation by coupling LNG cold energy with HyDesal can make it economically attractive and can strengthen the energy-water nexus. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

This paper presents results from a set of experiments performed on radiative condensers, deemed as a promising system to be integrated in building envelopes, following a literature review on fog condensers presented in a previous work. An analysis of condensation potential obtained using high emissivity substrates and titanium dioxide nanocoatings is presented, as well as the influence of sample position and orientation, and impact of climatic variables. Finally, the role of nanotechnology in overcoming limitations of radiative systems is discussed as a means to increase harvesting efficiency with functionalized, engineered nano-patterns on collector surface. Based on biomimicry principles, nanocoatings including nanoscale 3D optimal geometries are discussed, and the use of nanoimprint technology (NIL) is proposed to massively produce nano-patterned panels with biomimetic fog capturing features. © 2018 CIWEM},

	abstract = {Identifying optimal Water Quality Monitoring Stations (WQMS) with high values of information on the entire reservoir status, instead of all potential WQMS would significantly reduce the monitoring network expenditure while providing adequate spatial coverage. This study presented a new methodology for spatio-temporal multi-criteria optimization of reservoir WQMS based on Value of Information (VOI), Transinformation Entropy (TE), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE), and IRanian Water Quality Index (IRWQI). Although, all mentioned methods and concepts are well-known and have been used in water resources management, but their integration into a specific application for spatio-temporal multi-criteria optimization of reservoir WQMS is definitely an innovation and a contribution to improvement of WQMS design. More specifically, maximizing VOI as a decision-makers’ design criteria for optimization of WQMS, and considering spatial and temporal variations of water quality at different reservoir depths are new innovations in this research. The multi-objective optimization model was based on three objectives: 1) minimizing costs; 2) maximizing VOI; and 3) minimizing TE (redundant information). Considering these objectives, the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization method was used to find Pareto-optimal solutions. The most preferable solution was then determined using PROMETHEE multi-criteria decision making method. The proposed methodology was applied to Karkheh Reservoir with more than 5 billion cubic meter capacity and 60 km length that is one of the largest reservoirs in Southwestern Iran, however, the proposed approach has the ability to be generalized for any generic reservoir. Considering equal weights for criteria, PROMETHEE method resulted in 6 optimized WQMS out of 60 potential ones and a period of 25 days for optimal sampling interval. The optimized monitoring stations were mainly located at deep parts where most water quality variations are expected to occur. To show sensitivity of the model to different weights, 4 scenarios with various relative weights were evaluated in the PROMETHEE method. Results indicated that by increasing the weight of the second criterion (maximizing VOI), the number of optimized WQMS increased and the sampling interval decreased. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The paper takes a review of water conservancy development in China in three stages since the founding of the modern China in 1949, and demonstrates that the smart water grid(SWG) project is an integrated carrier driving the implementation of China's water management modernization strategy. After a systemic analysis of the dual structure of current water grid system in China, namely the natural and the artificial, water flow and water basis, the ecological environment and the social-economy, the paper puts forward that SWG is a network amalgam of physical, information and management flow of water, and that SWG is featured by Security, Measurability, Accessibility, Resource-optimization and Technological-innovation, supporting the connectivity of water flow, information flow and business flow. The paper explains the key techniques for constructing a physical network of water that include quasi-nature ecological treatment of rivers and lakes, planning of water infrastructure network, safe and friendly construction of large water engineering under complex conditions; the key techniques for constructing a water information network that include intelligent sensing and multi-source 3D monitoring, multi-source water information integration and data-mining, and multi-scale forecast and prediction; and the key techniques for a water management network that include empirical-based water resources optimized allocation, multi-objective comprehensive scheduling of complex water resources systems, and nonlinear, intelligent control of water engineering project clusters. In its final analysis, the paper proposes the direction of Chinese SWG project construction in the future. © 2018, China Water Power Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Water is a major factor limiting crop production in many regions around the world. Irrigation can greatly enhance crop yields, but the local availability and timing of freshwater resources constrains the ability of humanity to increase food production. Innovations in irrigation infrastructure have allowed humanity to utilize previously inaccessible water resources, enhancing water withdrawals for agriculture while increasing pressure on environmental flows and other human uses. While substantial additional water will be required to support future food production, it is not clear whether and where freshwater availability is sufficient to sustainably close the yield gap in cultivated lands. The extent to which irrigation can be expanded within presently rainfed cropland without depleting environmental flows remains poorly understood. Here we perform a spatially explicit biophysical assessment of global consumptive water use for crop production under current and maximum attainable yield scenarios assuming current cropping practices. We then compare these present and anticipated water consumptions to local water availability to examine potential changes in water scarcity. We find that global water consumption for irrigation could sustainably increase by 48\% (408 km3 H2O yr-1) - expanding irrigation to 26\% of currently rainfed cultivated lands (2.67 × 106 km2) and producing 37\% (3.38 × 1015 kcal yr-1) more calories, enough to feed an additional 2.8 billion people. If current unsustainable blue water consumption (336 km3 yr-1) and production (1.19 × 1015 kcal yr-1) practices were eliminated, a sustainable irrigation expansion and intensification would still enable a 24\% increase in calorie (2.19 × 1015 kcal yr-1) production. Collectively, these results show that the sustainable expansion and intensification of irrigation in selected croplands could contribute substantially to achieving food security and environmental goals in tandem in the coming decades. © 2018 The Author(s).

Also marker-assisted selection breeding research, recent technologies such as molecular design breeding and gene editing for water using efficiency were also conducted. Seven wheat varieties were selected, two of which were examined at the national level. Representative works like "wheat genetics", which was the foundation for physiological genetic breeding of drought and water-saving in crops won two second prizes of the National Science and Technology Progress Award. With respect to macro research, we carried out researches on high-water efficiency agriculture in dry land, water resources and food security, wheat adaption to climate change, green agriculture to increase grain yield and efficiency. We put forward the construction of Huanghuai South Second Granary and more than thirty important consulting reports adopted by the national and local governments and leaders.

The mitigation of these challenges depends on the monitoring and assessment of multiple factors, including demography, education, health, and the environment; however, the inclusion of environmental factors are limited. The monitoring and assessment of environmental factors will continuously generate big data and hence would require scientific and technological innovation for a sustainable management plan. This study identifies six environmental factors, which should be integrated in the development of smart cities. These environmental factors include indicators of landscape and geography, climate, atmospheric pollution, water resources, energy resources, and urban green space as a major component of the environment.

For this purpose, the classical Mann-Kendall (MK), Spearman's rho (SR), Sen's slope, and linear regression approaches are applied frequently in the literature. Recently, innovative trend analysis (ITA) provides visual inspection and identification of categorical trends, which is one of the main concerns in this paper. On the basis of ITA methodology, several improvements namely double-ITA (D-ITA) and triple-ITA (T-ITA) procedures are suggested using with simple ITA together. These methods are attractive for the trend stability assessment by comparing partial trend components during different sub-periods of a given record series. Furthermore, partial MK test approach is proposed in this paper for the same purpose. These procedures and approach are applied to a set of annual rainfall records at many stations in different regions of Turkey. As a result, the comparison of the suggested methods based on partial sub-series of the same time series helps to improve trend detection with stability identification. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Water-related issues are becoming a limiting factor for sustainable economic growth and require a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, to foster innovative solutions. This paper provides an evidence-based contribution to understanding Triple Helix Model (THM) relations and the path to innovation policy in the water sector. The analysis focuses on the interaction between university-industry-government, with specific reference to the Murcia region in Southeast Spain. This region combines a chronic shortage of water and a leading role for agriculture. Starting from the experience of a researcher, working for the General Water Council of the Murcia Region, this paper is based on both desk research and in-depth personal interviews with representatives of THM actors. In addition, a questionnaire was forwarded to all those companies in charge of providing water services in the Murcia region. The study has found that stakeholders are not fully cooperative in seeking innovation. The main challenges are the renewal of water-related facilities and the improvement of remote control systems, denitrification and desalination technologies and achieving better energy efficiency. To this aim, THM approach is suggested as a source of local innovation policies, identifying a series of tools to foster a collaborative approach. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Climate change has been shown to directly influence evapotranspiration, which is one of the crucial watershed processes. The common approach to its calculation is via mathematical equations, such as 1985 Hargreaves-Samani (HS85). It computes reference evapotranspiration (ETo) through three climatic variables and one constant: RA (extra-terrestrial radiation), TC (mean temperature), TR (temperature range) and KR (empirical coefficient). To make HS85 more accurate, one of its authors proposed an equation for KR as a function of TR in 2000 (HS00). Both models are 4D and their internal behaviours are difficult to understand, hence, the data driven applications prevalent among experts and managers. In this study, we introduce an innovative research by trying to respond to two questions. What are the relationships between TC and TR? What are the internal patterns of HS hyperspace (4D domain) and the changes in ETo possibilities of the two models? In the proposed approach, thresholds for the four variables are utilized to cover majority of the agroclimatic situations in the world and the hyperspace is discretized with more than 50,000 calculation nodes. The ETo results show that under various climatic conditions, the behaviour of HS is nonlinear (more for HS00) leading to an increased uncertainty particularly for data driven applications. TC and TR show patterns useful for regions with less data. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Conjunctive water management involves the combined use of groundwater, surface water and/or additional sources of water to achieve public policy and management goals. Conjunctive water management enables greater water supply security and stability, helps adaptation to climate variation and uncertainty and reduces depletion and degradation of water resources. There are many opportunities to benefit from improved conjunctive water management if institutional and political barriers can be overcome. This article provides the first comprehensive assessments of progress towards conjunctive water management on a continental scale across the Australian States and Territories, and suggests an innovative approach towards overcoming barriers to integration. Conditions for the implementation of conjunctive water management have only been partially met by the Australian States. There has been progress towards integrated groundwater and surface water accounting and planning, but there is still little systematic attempt to plan and manage surface water and groundwater storage and use at a regional scale over time. Current policies effectively subsidise surface water storage and aquifer storage and recovery entitlements are not in place in some jurisdictions. A new paradigm of conjunctive water management is required involving systematic consideration of the beneficial integration of groundwater, surface water and other water sources in water plans and projects. Transition to conjunctive water management can be promoted by networks including change agents, bridging organisations and water management institutions supported by strong leadership from governments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cities in the Global South are facing high climate vulnerabilities. Still, systematic insights in factors that stimulate or impede governance capacity are less widely available than those in the Global North. Moreover, translating relevant scientific insights into policy and practice is often problematic. Hence, there is a need for feasible interactive approaches that may facilitate integration between science and policy. In this paper, we assess to what extent the City Blueprint Approach may facilitate such meaningful science-policy interaction. This approach has been developed in the context of Watershare and the European Innovation Partnership on Water. We discuss the content of the approach and reflect on the process of applying it in the case of Ahmedabad, India. First, we carried out an overall assessment of Ahmedabad’s trends, pressures, and integrated water resources management. Important challenges of Ahmedabad are water pollution, water scarcity (decline of groundwater levels), heat risk and urbanisation. Second, a governance capacity assessment provided a clearer understanding of the main enabling and limiting conditions that determine the city’s ability to govern these challenges. It was found that the governance conditions regarding learning, stakeholder engagement and implementing capacity are most in need of improvement. Next, we zoomed in on a specific development in which these limiting governance conditions were better developed: Ahmedabad’s Heat Action Plan. Based on our results and experiences, we reflect on the generalisability of the findings on the City Blueprint Approach (CBA)’s usefulness for improving science-policy interactions and water governance to India as well as the Global South more generally. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The Leh district of Ladakh region in Jammu and Kashmir state is located in the Trans-Himalayan ranges. This region has unique and rich ecological knowledge. The objective of the current study is to document the rich traditional methods for water conservation and management system in this district. The data was collected through extensive survey, Interview, open-ended questionnaire, group discussion and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) methods. The indigenous technologies like complex irrigation canals systems and traditional water storage ponds \{\vphantom{\}}Zing) are in use for water storage and distribution. The traditional watermills (Rantak) are also in use for grinding barley, wheat and pea. Atotal of 57 canals and 50 storage ponds were recorded in the study area. Also, a total of 150 Rantaks, which were functional before ten years, now decreases to 72 functional Rantaks were recorded In the study area. There is very strong community bond among the villagers, all worfc together for maintaining the canals and storage ponds. They have developed a ways of life and community Institutions that facilitate them to minimize conflicts, optimize their use and maintain their water security. They are very spiritual and strongly believe In co-existence with the nature. Anthropogenic activities like construction without proper rituals consider pollution and believes it disturbs the earth bound numen called Lhu. The untimely melting of glacier and unseasonal snow in the region added much pressure on the scare water resource for irrigation. Introducing the novel Innovation like artificial glacier, they are trying to minimize the water shortage mainly in the Spring season. To tackle the current situation of water shortage, there Is need of strengthening and amalgamation of traditional knowledge with the new innovation to overcome the water scarcity and also to bring the large cutivable barren land of Ladakh under plantation. © 2018 Ecological Society of India.

To meet these challenges, innovative technological developments must lead to increased adoption of water and resource recovery processes, while addressing stakeholder needs (e.g., innovators, practitioners, regulators). A test bed network of over 90 partner facilities within the United States and abroad will help accelerate innovation and widespread adoption of novel processes through multiscale testing and demonstration of technologies. In this paper, we define a common set of environmental, economic, technical, and social performance metrics for innovative technologies, that will meet the needs of multiple stakeholders in the decision-making process. These triple bottom line performance metrics can be used to track the sustainability of technologies in a consistent and transparent manner, while aiding the decision-making process for WRRFs. © 2018 Water Environment Federation.},

The Municipal Master Plans (MMP) must contemplate the guidelines outlined in the Water Plans, leading to the sustainable transformation of the territory with less impact on the rivers. This work aimed to analyze the interaction of water and soil plans. The innovation here presented was the use of Significant Water Management Issues (QSiGA) as tool to compare the master plans of the cities of Lisbon-PT and Porto Alegre-BR, located in different realities. The attendance of the QSiGA by the PDM of Lisbon and Porto Alegre was of 77.8\% and 61.1\%, respectively. Both cities are concerned about the quality and quantity of water, but do not fully observe the national guidelines. We believe in the relevance of this study to the materialization of a method of benchmarking the PDM, which can be used by countries with different realities. We conclude that in light of the non-compliance with the national guidelines, additional studies are needed to establish a methodology that integrates effectively water plans with master plans. © 2019 Editora CHAMPAGNAT.

	abstract = {Research and development has established a proof of concept for the coupling of an industrial seawater desalination unit with solar energy cells, without batteries. This new concept, Osmosun, has yet to be described in literature. It was the core purpose of Demos, an innovation project partly funded by the French "Programme des Investissements d'Avenir" (PIA 2). This paper reports the results and performances of two Osmosun industrial units for solar seawater desalination after several months of operation, in order to demonstrate their energy and performance potentials for drinking water production. The first unit was tested in Ghantoot (Abou Dhabi, UAE) on the platform dedicated to enhancement of seawater desalination processes, under the control of Masdar. The second one, was installed on the site of the Bora Bora (French Polynesie) drinking water works, nearby two conventional reverse osmosis units operated by the Polynésienne des Eaux staff. The total solar energy at both Ghantoot and Bora Bora was almost the same, but it was rather steady at Ghantoot and fluctuated a lot at Bora Bora. The operating conditions of the Osmosun process were adjusted on each site in order to protect the membranes against the pressure changes due to energy fluctuations, as well as to obtain optimized qualitative and quantitative conditions for the production of drinking water according to local standards. Finally, hybridation of DC/AC energy sources was tested and may allow a better return on capital investments when the electric grid is available. As such, the OSMOSUN process can offer affordable technical and economic conditions for the drinking water supply of populations located in both insular and arid zones. © 2019 Assoc.

In order to accelerate the construction of ecological civilization and implement important national strategies such as the 'Water Pollution Prevention Action Plan', focusing on improving the quality of groundwater environment in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, the four main problems of groundwater environment in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region were analyzed: (1) Groundwater is seriously polluted, and lacks scientific risk management and pollution control strategies; (2) Groundwater pollution sources are wide-ranging, pollution supervision system needs to be improved; (3) Integrated innovation and engineering demonstration of groundwater pollution classification and treatment need to be carried out; (4) The problem of groundwater over-exploitation is serious, and there is an urgent need to develop groundwater safety replenishment technology. The existing groundwater environmental management foundations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region were systematically sorted out, and four research directions and objectives of groundwater pollution prevention and control in the '13th Five-Year Plan' were proposed: (1) Carry out research on groundwater pollution characteristic identification and systematic prevention, and improve the top-level design of groundwater pollution prevention and control; (2) Develop breakthrough technologies for accurate identification and monitoring of groundwater pollution and improve the groundwater environmental monitoring capability in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region; (3) Research and develop source control and pollution repair technologies to improve the groundwater remediation capacity of contaminated sites; (4) Carry out replenishment suitability and environmental risk assessment of the replenishment area, and establish a coordinated and efficient technology system for safe replenishment.

	abstract = {Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operator is one of the aggregation operators in a Pythagorean fuzzy decision making environment. In most cases, it is assumed that all elements in Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFSs) are independent. However, in real life of decision problems, most of the criteria are interrelated. Population size in a solid waste management decision, for example, is related to human health since the two criteria are mutually dependent. This paper aims to introduce an aggregation operator that purposely dealt with the interactions between elements of PFSs. The Choquet integral operator is used to propose an innovation to the Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher operator. Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher Choquet integral average operators (PFHCIA) and Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher Choquet integral geometric operators (PFHCIG) are proposed. The beauty of the proposed operators is it consider the interaction of the criteria in the decision making process. The proposed aggregation operators are the extension to the Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators where Choquet integral is used to handle interactions between criteria. As the case study is considered, a water resource management problem is presented to portraythe application the proposed approach. Comparable results are also presented to check its feasibility and effectiveness. It is shown that the ranking using the proposed operators are inconsistent with the existing method. The importance of an aggregation function that can capture the problem of interdependence between the criteria is the main contribution of this paper. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {The meaning about the origins of Al-Ain, the second largest city of Abu Dhabi Emirate in the UAE, resides in its name, which in Arabic means 'The spring'. The presence of abundant groundwater has allowed human settlements since the Neolithic period, marking this city as one of the oldest settlements continuously inhabited in the Gulf region. Under the rule of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nayan (1918-2004), Al-Ain received special attention in order to preserve its character and identity, due also to the presence of historical heritage which forms a strong sense of belonging for its community. With the establishment of the UAE in 1971, and the institution of its municipality council in 1992, a special ordinance fixed a strict limit on building height, giving also particular attention to conservation of the original landscape formed by the seven ancient oases of palm trees and their irrigation systems of aflaj, an ancient irrigation system common in most arid zones of the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Mediterranean. Despite all these efforts spent in order to keep its original identity, nowadays this approach appears to be scrutinised under the pressures for further expansion and innovation in response to an increasingly challenging economy. With an increasing acceleration in the process of expansion and renovation, most of Al-Ain's urban fabric, realized after oil discovery in the 1960s, and still belonging to traditional typologies, has been replaced with new constructions inspired by different models, and new large developments have been laid out to cope with the increasing demand for dwellings. After recognition in 2011 of Al-Ain's archaeological sites and oases as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city's popularity rose as a tourist destination and place of cultural interest but has revealed in the meantime its systemic fragility. This paper focuses on the process of urban growth according to the nature of place, which characterized Al-Ain's history and currently forms the substrate of its cultural identity, and the mechanism of conflict/interaction between identity and innovation towards the definition of Al-Ain's urban transformation and regenerative process. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.},

	abstract = {Water insecurity concerns drove San Antonio, Texas to pursue a controversial \$3.4 billion groundwater transfer project from central Texas aquifers. The 228 km Vista Ridge Pipeline (VRP) would increase water supplies by 20\%. Analysis through Q-Method revealed three social perspectives surrounding the VRP. Project Advocates offer particular views of urban water security, risk, and accountability. The creation of new hydro-social territories helps to explain Landowner Opposition, while Governance Failure offers a foundational criticism of the underlying assumptions and the institutional innovation of private-public partnership that advanced the VRP. Overall, our paper demonstrates that the VRP is differentiated according to views of risk, water law, and groundwater science. Policy deliberations on future urban water security should include these perspectives as a means to improve water governance, especially as policies and infrastructure for urban water security creates new hydro-social territories. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The complexity of challenges to ensure sustainable food security and reduction of the impact of food production on the environment calls for more innovation in agriculture. The need to innovate emphasises the need for partnerships and joint ventures that will enable the role-players in agricultural value chains to ensure a sustainable agricultural sector. South Africa experiences significant socioeconomic challenges, including poverty, high unemployment rates, food insecurity and economic decline. These are compounded by adverse climatic factors. The effect of declining water resources, extended droughts, increased desertification and climate change on food security and economic growth prompted the South African government to develop policies and strategies that are targeted towards coordinated, multi-disciplinary, -institutional and -sectoral responses to critical national priorities. These priorities include job creation, skills and enterprise development, poverty alleviation, and food and nutrition security. Aligned to these strategies, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) acknowledged the importance of strategic partnerships for the development of appropriate solutions. The objective was to establish a collaboration centre on broadening the food base with the purpose of ensuring the availability of a wide range of nutritious crops. The methodology was to develop new/novel crops, food products and ingredients for enterprise development, value chains, income generation and job creation. The necessity for researchers to collaborate in addressing these complex problems is of overriding importance. By bringing expertise from various disciplines and organisations together and leveraging other important networks and partners at both national and international levels, the benefits of greater returns within agricultural value chains will be realised. Cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia robusta) is increasingly becoming an important food, forage, cosmeceutical and nutraceutical crop in South Africa. It is a drought-tolerant crop used for a diverse range of applications. It was originally used mainly as a source of animal feed, but recent interest in its other potential uses saw the crop establish itself as an important multi-purpose crop, which opened up opportunities for the smallholder farming sector. Cactus pear was identified as a priority crop for research and development for the collaboration centre on broadening the food base. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the collaboration involved in developing this multi-functional crop within the context of the Sub-Sahara Africa Region Framework for Cactus Pear Research and Development. The establishment of the collaboration centre provided a sound foundation on which further partnerships could be explored and developed. Valuable lessons were learnt concerning the maintenance of multi-disciplinary research teams and challenges for the development and establishment of new value chains for new crops in a country. © 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science.

	abstract = {After four-decade significant economic growth and development, China sets a series of goals aiming at sustainable medium to high speed economic growth，reasonable equity, and better market oriented economy. In this pursue, agriculture will take a crucial role. Under the Health China 2030, National Nutrition Plan (2017-2030) and Rural Vitalization Strategy, more attention has been paid on nutrition both in policy and research field, meanwhile the linkage between agriculture and nutrition is enhancing, but the integration of Agriculture-Food Security-Nutrition system is not yet completed. During the economic transformation, agriculture and food industry will play a key role, especially when considering the nutrition and health status will impact the national physical fitness and therefore influence the economic transformation approach. It may also impact whether China can move out of the Middle Income Trap to some extent. In the new development era, China needs a new food security development strategy to improve the national nutrition status and sets of policies to strengthen the integration of agriculture and nutrition. This paper reviewed the major challenges about China’s food security and put forward a new vision based on international experiences, which aimed at providing recommendations for designing China’s food security strategy. The key food security challenges include natural and environmental pressure, such as insufficiency and degradation of land resources, shortage and pollution of water resources, climate change and extreme disaster, fiscal pressure caused by increasing agriculture subsidy, Triple Burden of malnutrition, food safety issues and food loss and waste. It requires institutional and technical innovations for the transformation of agriculture development which means that more value added, nutritious and healthy food should be produced, the productivity and efficiency of water, land and energy should be improved, and environmentally friendly social inclusive development should be considered. All of those call for a transformation of China’s food security strategy. This paper put forwards a new vision for China’s food security: China should set nutrition-oriented food security strategy with nutrition indicators as key targeted goals, aim to eliminate hunger and undernutrition by 2025 while effectively reducing overweight/ obesity and food safety risks. Therefore policy innovations are recommended including: Improve nutrition governance, Market motivated and nutrition oriented agriculture support system, Promote Nutrition-based Food Production, Establish efficient, safe, and inclusive food value chains, Policy innovation for sustainable nutritious diet and nutrition education, and Evidence based research to support policy making. © 2019 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

One of these sources is reused water, or highly treated reclaimed or recycled wastewater, a worthy addition to the portfolio of water-resource alternatives that increasing cities are considering in view of demographic and environmental changes. In this paper, we analyse communications from the media, policymakers and utility managers on the technology used to produce reused water for potable purposes. The focus of our analysis is technology as a means for producing safe and reliable water supply in the long-term. Three places were selected because of their differing experiences with social acceptance: Singapore, Orange County (California, United States), and Queensland (Australia). We found distinct differences in the communications used in the three places, which we believe have strongly influenced public opinion on the provision of clean water through potable water reuse. In communicating technological innovations to the public, it is essential to also discuss the broader framework affecting reliable water supplies. In this light, planning, legal and regulatory frameworks, institutional coordination, financial sustainability, and operational aspects should also be communicated. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the southern Athabasca Oil Sands (SAOS) Region, located in Alberta Canada, individual in-situ oil sands operators have conducted local geochemical and isotope groundwater studies to establish baseline characteristics and to improve understanding of the connectivity of water supply and disposal formations within individual leases. Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) initiated this study to combine the data from these individual studies along with public information into a comprehensive unified dataset to evaluate conceptual models of regional groundwater flow and the degree of interaction and separation between important water supply and disposal aquifers. The unified dataset comprised over 293 groundwater samples from the main water source and disposal hydrostratigraphic units and included geochemical and isotopic tracers that can be used to identify sources (δ 18 O and δ 2 H) and age of water ( 3 H) and associated solutes ( 14 C DIC , 36 Cl), as well as the sources of salinity and diagenetic processes (δ 13 C DIC , δ 34 S SO 4 , 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, δ 11 B, δ 37 Cl and δ 81 Br) and dissolved organics (δ 13 C DOC ). The TDS and stable isotope composition (δ 18 O and δ 2 H) of groundwater from several Cretaceous formations were used to identify three main mixing controls. i) Areas where locally recharged groundwater mixes with glaciogenic water were identified by lower δ 18 O and δ 18 O values, high TDS, Cl:Br and δ 34 S SO4 , 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and δ 37 Cl values consistent with dissolution of evaporites. These areas were situated where vertical pathways through otherwise competent formations are likely to occur. ii) Mixing with paleo-waters characterized by high TDS and higher δ 18 O and δ 2 H signatures indicating groundwater recharged under warmer climate periods and/or evaporative enrichment were identified in the south, and southwestern portions of the study area. The presence of these paleo-waters indicate slow-moving groundwater zones with limited lateral and vertical connectivity. iii) Areas with potential connectivity to shallow aquifers were identified by their lower TDS values, modern meteoric δ 18 O and δ 2 H signatures, HCO 3 type waters, and δ 34 S–SO 4 and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures, consistent with weathering of shallow aquifer material. Geochemical and isotopic indicators suggest that in areas where the Colorado Group aquitard is thin or absent, there is greater connectivity between the Grand Rapids Formation and the shallower aquifers. Interpretation of the new unified dataset has improved understanding of the extent that glacial recharge had on Devonian aquifers, and overlying Cretaceous formations, and identified zones with relatively stagnant groundwater flow, both of which have implications for regional groundwater resource development, monitoring and potential wastewater disposal. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current world population of 7.6 billion is expected to reach 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 210, with roughly 83 million people being added every year. The upward trend in population size along with an improved quality of life are expected to continue, and with them the demand for water. Available water for human consumption and development remains virtually the same. Additional to the different pressures of the demand side on the available resources (offer side), climate variability and change apply further pressures to the management of the resource. Additional to the increase in evaporation due to temperature rise, climate change is responsible for more frequent and intense water related extreme events, such as floods and droughts. Anthropogenic activities often result in the contamination of the few pristine water resources and exacerbate the effects of climate change. Furthermore, they are responsible for altering the state of the environment and minimizing the ecosystem services provided. Thus, the water security of countries is compromised posing harder challenges to poor countries to address it. This compromise is taking place in a complex context of scarce and shared resources. Across the world, 153 countries share rivers, lakes and aquifers, home to 40\% of the world's current population. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is the scientific arm of the United Nations and its International Hydrological Programme (IHP) is the main vehicle for work in water sciences at an intergovernmental level. IHP VIII, IHP's medium term strategy, aims to assist UNESCO's Member States (MS) in achieving water security by mobilizing international cooperation to improve knowledge and innovation, strengthening the science-policy interface, and facilitating education and capacity development in order to enhance water resource management and governance. Furthermore, the organization has established an UrbanWater Management Programme (UWMP) aiming at promoting sustainable water resource management in urban areas. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Federal agricultural land use policies in the United States aimed at protecting soil health and water quality typically rely on persuading individual farmers to voluntarily adopt conservation practices. An expanding body of literature suggests that private sector intermediaries, such as crop advisers, are increasingly trusted sources of information for farmers about conservation practices and thus may be persuasive actors in the conservation-adoption realm. While previous studies have explored farmers’ perceptions of crop advisers facilitating conservation practice adoption and participating in conservation programs in agricultural landscapes, little research to date has explored crop advisers’ perceptions of this role, and few agricultural land use policies have explicitly included crop advisers as conservation partners. This study fills a critical void in the literature by evaluating the Saginaw Bay Regional Conservation Partnership Program, an innovative agricultural policy that relies on crop advisers to recruit farmers into the program and assist them with the adoption of conservation practices. Through a survey and interviews with crop advisers in the Saginaw Bay watershed in Michigan, USA, we explore crop advisers’ perceptions of their role in the program and of delivering conservation information to farmers. We found that crop advisers have positive attitudes towards land/water resources and conservation practices, believe they have an important intermediary role to play in facilitating conservation practice adoption, and believe their supervisors are supportive of them promoting conservation. However, difficulties in collaboration and communication between the private and governmental sectors – resulting from perceived differences, operational differences, and territoriality – present a key barrier to crop advisers increasing their intermediary role in the promotion and implementation of federal conservation programs. Future research and policy initiatives should explore how to address public-private territoriality and whether crop advisers should be incentivized to deliver information about conservation practices and/or assist in enrolling farmers in federal conservation programs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The objective of this study was to better understand water sustainability and availability of the projected shale gas from 2018 to 2030 in the Weiyuan play, China. The water footprint framework was used to quantify the potential water use and environmental impacts on different time scales. The results showed that the water use per well ranged from 11,300 to 60,660 m3, with a median of 36,014 m 3 , totaling {\textasciitilde} 3.44 Mm 3 for 97 wells. Yearly evaluation results showed that the gray water footprint was the main contributor and accounted for 83.82\% to 96.76\%, which was dependent on the different treatment percentage scenario. The monthly environmental impact results indicated that the annual streamflow statistics were more likely to prevent water withdrawal. Water quality issues may be alleviated through recycling and retreatment measures that improve current waste water management strategies.

This paper combines a literature review and grounded theory approaches with data obtained from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) second and third National Communication reports. Among key adaptation measures that are emerging are sustainable management of water resources, water conservation and putting in place appropriate policies. The study concludes that there should be a shift towards a more balanced and integrated approach on water management through the implementation of adaptation measures. The findings highlight the need for policy approaches that use adaptive management approaches in water resources management including scaling up rainwater harvesting; water efficiency across all sectors of the economy, especially agriculture; desalination and groundwater recharging.

	abstract = {Surface water supply for a watershed relies on local water generated from precipitation and water connections with other watersheds. These connections are confined by topography and infrastructure, and respond diversely to stressors such as climate change, population growth, increasing energy and water demands. This study presents an integrative simulation and evaluation framework that incorporates the natural and anthropogenic water connections (i.e., stream flows, inter-basin water transfers, water withdrawals and return flows) among the 2099 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-8) watersheds across the conterminous United States. The framework is then applied to investigate the potential impacts of changes in climate and water use on regional water availability and water stress (the ratio of demand to supply). Our projections suggest that highly water-stressed areas may expand from 14\% to 18\% and the stressed population would increase from 19\% to 24\% by 2070–2099. Climate-change mitigation practices (e.g., energy structure reform, technology innovation) could largely offset these trends by reducing demand and enhancing supply. At the watershed scale, the spatially inhomogeneous responses to future changes suggest that regional water connectivity could significantly buffer the potential stress escalations due to the redistribution of water resources and diverse changes in consumptive uses and water supplies in different source areas. However, the detrimental future changes (e.g., depleting river discharges, larger demands of water withdrawal) may aggravate conflicts over water rights among regions and challenge our current water infrastructure system. This study provides new insights into the critical role of regional water connectivity in water supply security, and highlights the increasing need for integrated monitoring and management of water resources at various spatial levels in a changing world. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Rural water conservancy is crucial to the development of agriculture which is the foundation of national economy in China. During the period of the 12th Five-Year Plan from 2011 to 2015, Chinese government promoted the rural water conservancy investment vigorously and obtained some achievements. Meanwhile, there were some problems faced in the rural water conservancy such as a weak foundation of rural water conservancy, an uneven distribution of rural water resources by time and space, low investment efficiency. Therefore, the investment efficiency of rural water conservancy needs to be systematically and comprehensively evaluated, and the evaluation results for the period of the 12th Five-Year Plan from 2011 to 2015 can provide reliable references for China's rural water conservancy investment over the period of the 13th Five-Year Plan from 2016 to 2020. Based on the existing study findings, this study conductes the empirical analysis for the investment efficiency of China's rural water conservancy during the period of 2011 to 2015 using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Malmquist productivity index (MPI) model from the spatiotemporal perspective. The statistical data of the 31 provinces over the period of 2011 to 2015 are gathered as inputs and outputs of the DEA model and MPI model. It finds that the average investment efficiency of China's rural water conservancy in each year during the study period is 0.732 and the investment efficiency fluctuates for the same period, which is mainly caused by scale efficiency (SE). The investment efficiency of China's rural water conservancy is decreased by an average of 1.2\% from 2011 to 2015, which is principally due to technology change (TC). From the regional aspect, the investment efficiency of rural water conservancy in the eastern, central, northeast and western regions increase successively, which means uneven distribution of investment efficiency among the four regions. Based on the MPI analysis of the four regions, only the investment efficiency of eastern region improved by an average of 4.3\% for each year, while the investment efficiency of the other three regions all decreased. At the provincial level, disequilibrium in the investment efficiency of rural water conservancy existed in the 31 provinces. Only the four provinces including Shanghai, Hainan, Tibet and Xinjiang were DEA efficiency for each year during the study period. The improvement of the investment efficiency among the 31 provinces in China mainly relied on the investment expansion and the technology innovation of rural water conservancy. Furthermore, the method provided in this study can be not only used to analyze the investment efficiency of rural water conservancy in other developing countries, but also to evaluate the investment efficiency of the other fields in the time and space dimensions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

The results show that the water utilization efficiency presents a "U"-shaped trend as a whole, declines incrementally along the eastern, central, and western regions of the economic belt, and that the water utilization efficiency of the economic belt first converges and then diverges. In the estimation of the double threshold panel model, when the per capita GDP is lower than 2.635 or greater than 12.058 thousand dollars, the environmental regulation shows a significant positive effect. Otherwise, the environmental regulation barely shows a significant negative effect. FDI has not had a great impact on water resources utilization efficiency, and neither the "pollution aura" nor "pollution shelter" are significant. When the per capita GDP is lower than 2.184 or greater than 12.058 thousand dollars, FDI can significantly improve the water utilization efficiency through environmental regulation. Besides, the positive effects of technological innovation and foreign trade dependence are significant, and so are the negative effects of industrialization. Differentiated environmental regulation policies should be formulated; industrial upgrade should be promoted; innovation of water-saving and emission reduction should be strengthened in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In 2013, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation engaged twenty citizens with diverse water interests as the Yellowstone Basin Advisory Council (YBAC). The purpose of the YBAC was to provide basin-specific recommendations for an updated water plan. Our research group documented the degree to which the YBAC incorporated scientific and technical information into its deliberations and final recommendations. Based on empirical evidence, this study illuminated three dynamics that discouraged the group’s use of certain sets of scientific and technical information. However, we also found that the convening managers, technical experts, and YBAC members were operating as pragmatic participants who created deliberative spaces where tensions between conflicting goals and values did not need to be addressed head-on. We argue that because this pragmatism guided certain scientific issues to the sideline, it helped the group pre-empt conditions of intractability that would otherwise threaten the overall collaborative process. While the sidelining was important in terms of “getting things done,” it, nonetheless, marginalized some important scientific issues. To validate and advance our findings, we presented the YBAC case, the dynamics that sidelined science, and our corrective recommendations to water resources professionals. We then solicited their ideas for specific strategies they might employ to avoid sidelining essential scientific and technical information. As a research innovation, their inputs help close the loop between critical observations and practice. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

As the largest freshwater lake in China, the Poyang Lake region and its five major tributaries are facing serious problems, including the reduction of water quantity, soil erosion, shoreline shrinkage and deterioration of aquatic habitat, whereas the current research level and key technologies cannot meet the requirements of ecological priority and green high-quality development.

	abstract = {A total maximum daily load for the Chesapeake Bay requires reduction in pollutant load from sources within the Bay watersheds. The Conestoga River watershed has been identified as a major source of sediment load to the Bay. Upland loads of sediment from agriculture are a concern; however, a large proportion of the sediment load in the Conestoga River has been linked to scour of legacy sediment associated with historic millpond sites. Clarifying this distinction and identifying specific segments associated with upland vs. channel sources has important implications for future management. In order to address this important question, we combined the strengths of two widely accepted watershed management models — Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for upland agricultural processes, and Hydrologic Simulation Program FORTRAN (HSPF) for instream fate and transport — to create a novel linked modeling system to predict sediment loading from critical sources in the watershed including upland and channel sources, and to aid in targeted implementation of management practices. The model indicates approximately 66\% of the total sediment load is derived from instream sources, in agreement with other studies in the region and can be used to support identification of these channel source segments vs. upland source segments, further improving targeted management. The innovated linked SWAT-HSPF model implemented in this study is useful for other watersheds where both upland agriculture and instream processes are important sources of sediment load. © 2019 American Water Resources Association},

	abstract = {Climate change is observed globally, and the projections predict that the change will continue in the future for quite a long time. The mitigation and adaptation to climate change, however, are offering tremendous business opportunities around the world, especially for businesses operating in the agri-food, energy, finance, and health sectors, water infrastructure, built environments, and other relevant services. When the severity of heat waves is considered, for instance, it would become quite clear that the demand for cooling would accelerate, putting further stress on energy supply and increasing the risk of electricity black outs. Similarly, the projections also provide warnings about increased drought risk in many regions around the globe, and even worse, it should also be emphasized that 60\% more food will be needed globally, while 100\% more demand for food is projected in developing countries by the year 2050. While all these are being projected, we are experiencing progressively increasing stress on our global freshwater resources, which are worsened further by climate change-driven impacts and water pollution. Consequently, reducing agri-food production systems' susceptibility to climate change and strengthening the resilience of such systems are extremely important to sustain and improve the livelihoods of billions of people around the globe. Moreover, reducing emissions due to fossil fuels consumption and production is vital for the whole global population, and agri-food and energy sectors have tremendous potentials for reducing inefficiencies and emissions while simultaneously playing their crucial roles in food and energy security as well as poverty reduction. Both of these sectors are facing significant climate change-driven challenges, which provide ample opportunities for cutting-edge novel knowledge and innovative products, processes, services, and policies. And due to the reciprocal relationships between climate change and agri-food and energy innovations, in return, complementing the other forms, such innovations will speed up the climate change mitigation and adaptation processes. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The climate change has an increasingly serious impact on water resources and grain production. Strengthening scientific research in relevant fields of climate change and enhancing grain production in order to adapt to climate change is of vital significance to guarantee food security, improve farmers’ income and maintain social stability. This paper constructs a new economic-climate model based on the original Cobb-Dougla (C-D) production function by adding climate factors, and empirically analyzes the impacts of climate change on grain yield and illustrates regional differences. Constraints of water resource restriction on agricultural yields and agricultural planting structure are also proposed. Based on the analysis of the correlation between climate change and grain yield, the relationship between the use of irrigation water and irrigation is proposed. Human factors such as agricultural technology innovation, policy mechanism guarantee and increase in farmland water conservancy construction investment can mitigate all kinds of negative impacts of climate warming on the Chinese agricultural water to a certain extent. © 2019},

	abstract = {An overview of the urban shallow groundwater dynamics in Jakarta is provided. The modifications to the water budget at the micro and mesoscale due to anthropogenic influences are described and the diffusive nature of the interaction analysed. The scale of urbanisation ({\textgreater}10 million residents) in conjunction with the lack of infrastructure for water-related services is seen to have fostered a dependency on the shallow groundwater resources and, in turn, led to a tangible impact on the groundwater domain, which is difficult to quantify and study. Using short duration yet high temporal resolution groundwater level data collected at an urban site within Jakarta, two metrics are developed that can describe the daily variation in groundwater levels driven by the human interaction. Numerical models of varying complexity for the urban shallow groundwater dynamics are then used. Here, by employing a process of gradually improving the model's physical description while performing parameter estimation based on the new metrics, the study provides evidence of the role of the unsaturated zone in influencing the urban shallow groundwater dynamics. We further identify Jakarta's wastewater seepage as the crucial yet overlooked component of the urban cycle, having direct implications for the region's water security. The innovation of this study lies at the combination of high temporal resolution data with flexible modelling frameworks that can be developed to give insights into rapidly growing, unstructured stressors on water resources in data poor Mega Cities from the developing world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

This study relied on the four pillars of sustainability and the EU cross-compliance legislative objective for the minimization of the climate change impact. The multi-criteria evaluation methodology was based on the results of four different types of analyses: a DPSIR analysis, a SWOT analysis, a Cost-Benefit Analysis and a climate change impacts analysis. Public participation on the results of the study with local stakeholders was used at every stage of the multi-criteria evaluation process, from the selection and weighing of the criteria to the final ranking and measures' prioritization. The PoM contains two types of measures: basic measures which deal with the implementation of existing legislation and are the same for all regions of Greece and additional measures which are specified for the Region of Crete. The results of the prioritization process in Geropotamos Basin suggests that improving the water quality and ecological status of available water resources do not always require significant financial resources and can have a high impact in terms of achieving “good” quality status. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Provision of improved water infrastructure technologies and innovation can address challenges posed by water shortages to environmental sustainability. China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project has generated extensive debates over sustainability of water resources system in the northern drier region, which faces severe water scarcity hindering ecosystems, agriculture, industries and livelihoods. Some arguments extend the views that large infrastructure projects can have negative implications for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem goods and services. However, this study strengthens the opposite view, as such projects would resolve increasing environmental challenges northern China has been facing over many decades due to severe water shortages. The project empowers connectivity among individuals, community, and organizations that the sustainability of goods and services such as energy, irrigation and water supply are perceived, and livelihoods and the standard of peoples' living is improved. A resilient, robust and adaptive water infrastructure framework can overcome the challenges of water shortages by meeting a long term social, economic and environmental goals for water resources systems in northern China. Such framework can also identify the thresholds of change and the threats associated with environmental sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Poverty has always been a worldwide problem, especially for developing countries. The agricultural industry poverty alleviation is one of the most effective methods to improve the ability of the poor, improve the livelihood level of the rural family, and achieve sustainable development in the future. With the introduction and implementation of the "precise poverty alleviation concept" by the Chinese government, analyses of whether agricultural industry's precise poverty alleviation can become an effective way to increase the income of the poor or not, determination of what are the leading factors of the spatial and temporal differentiation of agricultural industry poverty alleviation efficiencies, and further scientifically revealing the poverty alleviation efficiency of the agricultural industry and its mechanism are of vital importance. The previous research mainly focuses on the field of economics, however, in this paper, we used innovative analysis for this research problem from a geospatial perspective using Wanzhou District, a national poverty-stricken county in the Southwestern Mountainous Area with a rate of alleviate poverty of 88\% from the year 2013 to 2018 under the government program. The main innovations of this paper included that (1) an indicator system was constructed for factors that affected agricultural industry poverty alleviation efficiency based on the spatial perspective, and the industrial poverty alleviation efficiency was measured by the improved DEA efficiency model, spatial autocorrelation Global Moran's I model and geo-detector; (2) a framework of action mechanisms between dominant influencing factors and industrial poverty alleviation efficiency was established. The spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of agricultural industry poverty alleviation efficiency, and its dominant influencing factors in 41 townships in the study area in 2013, 2015 and 2018 were further analyzed by the natural breakpoint classification method, Moran index, and geo-detector, and (3) a framework of the dominant factors that affected the efficiency of industrial poverty alleviation was set up, which can be conducive to improving China's anti-poverty model and the mechanism of industrial poverty alleviation, and further provided decision-making suggestions to alleviate the multi-dimensional poverty in the rural areas of the southwestern mountainous area. Moreover, the data in this paper were collected from the Chinese agricultural sector, the township government departments, the poverty alleviation office and the national land department, which was really reliable, the software such as SPSS 25.0,Arcgis10.2 and GeoDa095 were used for analysis. The main conclusions and policy recommendations of this paper were, (1) the industrial poverty alleviation policy had effectively promoted the overall increase in the poverty alleviation efficiency of the county industry in the southwestern mountainous area. Its policy intervention had a positive effect on promoting the poverty alleviation of the poor, the longer the intervention time, the more obvious the efficiency of industrial poverty alleviation, especially in deep poverty towns. (2) The industrial poverty alleviation efficiency showed obvious high-value clusters and low-value clusters. The high-value gathering area was located in the flat dam area along the Yangtze River with abundant water resources and flat terrain. The low-value gathering area was concentrated in the high-altitude mountainous area with a steep slope. (3) The substitution of family and economic factors by policy factors and social factors had become the two main types of factors affecting the efficiency of industrial poverty alleviation in Wanzhou District, and the influence of policy factors was greater than that of social factors. Specifically, with the continuous implementation of the precise poverty alleviation policy, the five major social factors of road density, characteristic planting, labor skill training, agricultural insurance and poverty alleviation credit funds, market participation and human resources level gradually replaced the family economy factor, and became the leading influencing factors for the poverty alleviation efficiency. Finally, this paper offers several feasible suggestions for policy direction and future research according to the research results. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Water shortages in Pakistan are among the most severe in the world, and its water resources are decreasing significantly due to the prevailing hydro-meteorological conditions. We assessed variations in meteorological and hydrological variables using innovative trend analysis (ITA) and traditional trend analysis methods at a practical significance level, which is also of practical interest. We developed threshold levels of hydrological variables and developed a non-parametric climate-sensitivity model of the high-altitude catchment of the western Himalayas. The runoff of Zone I decreased, while the temperature increased and the precipitation increased significantly. In Zone II, the runoff and temperature increased but the precipitation decreased. A two-dimensional visualization of the Pardé coefficient showed extreme drought events, and indicated greater sensitivity of the hydrological regime to temperature than to precipitation. The threshold levels of runoff for Zones I and II were 320 and 363 mm using the Q80 fixed method, while the mean runoff amounts were estimated to be 79.95 and 55.61 mm, respectively. The transient threshold levels varied by month, and the duration of droughts in Zones I and II ranged from 26.39 to 78.98 days. The sensitivity of the hydrological regime was estimated based on a modified climate-elasticity model (εp = 0.11-0.23, εt = -0.04-2.39) for Zones I and II, respectively. These results highlight the sensitivity of the hydrological regime to temperature, which influences the melting process. However, it is important to establish thresholds for hydrological variables and understand the climate sensitivity of the hydrological regime of the entire basin, so that policy makers and water managers can make sustainable water-resource-management decisions for this region. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Water depletion and pollution caused by industrialization have become major environmental concerns worldwide, which are further complicated by the urbanization and globalization. China has become an industrial powerhouse for the world, and its industrial activities-induced water pressure is no longer negligible. This study investigates China's industrial water pressure from final consumption and international export based on water footprint (WF)and dynamic structure decomposition analysis (SDA). The industrial blue and gray WFs with respect to rural consumption, urban consumption, and export are accounted for 2002–2015, and an advanced dynamic SDA model is developed and applied to examining the evolving WFs with 9 socio-economic drivers quantified. Results show that China's water resources pressure is intensified due to the increase of total industrial blue WF (by 47.4\%)for 2002–2015, whereas a mitigation of water environment pressure is suggested by the decreasing gray virtual water outflow and total internal gray WF (by 31.9\% and 36.4\%, respectively). The SDA demonstrates that export scale and urban consumption level are two major drivers of water situation deterioration, which accumulatively contribute 38.3\% and 33.0\% to the evolving blue and gray WFs, respectively. In contrast, technology development is the dominant contributor alleviating China's water pressure, with absolute contribution proportions of 38.9\% and 56.5\%, correspondingly. Based on these, export regulation, consumption pattern adjustment and technological innovation are recommended for water policy making. The methodology used in this study can be extended to diagnosing the water issues in other nations/regions as well. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The production of irrigated rice is increasingly challenged by freshwater scarcity. Water saving technologies such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) allow sustaining production levels under reduced water availability. Before implementing such innovations on a large scale, their hydrological impact on the system needs to be assessed. This study investigated the applicability of the water management tool WEAP (Water Evaluation and Planning System) for evaluating the effects of AWD on water use and water resources at field and irrigation system level for two different case studies in Central Luzon, the Philippines. In the first study, the Zeigler Experiment Station (ZES) of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was used for parameterization of WEAP and field-scale assessment of AWD, making use of the availability of spatially and temporally highly resolved data. In the second study, WEAP was applied to an irrigation scheme in the Philippines, the Angat-Maasim River Irrigation System (AMRIS) to assess effects on up- and downstream water resources using lower resolution data. Simulated AWD implementation during the dry season reduced water requirements by 12–27\% and 34.3\% on ZES and AMRIS, respectively. Additionally, AWD implementation enhanced streamflow in main and lateral canals, and thus increased water availability in the entire irrigation system. We also conducted an ex-ante assessment of future freshwater availability assuming reduced precipitation due to climate change effects alongside with irrigation supply at current levels. WEAP showed that water levels in the reservoir will substantially decline under these circumstances leading to severe water stress in AMRIS. Implementing AWD in such a scenario improved water availability in the system by up to 50\%. WEAP proved to be a suitable tool for upscaling different irrigation techniques and assessing their impact on water resources on a large scale. Limitations of the approach and future possibilities for improvements are discussed. © 2019},

In this study, 124 urban WMPs across the United States were reviewed to characterize historic approaches and identify emerging trends in watershed planning. Planning methods and tools were qualitatively evaluated, followed by statistical analyses of a subset of 63 WMPs to identify relationships between planning factors. Plans developed by a municipality or consultant were associated with more occurrences of hydrologic modeling and site-specific recommendations, and fewer occurrences of characterizing social watershed factors, than plans authored by agencies, organizations, or universities. WMPs in the past decade exhibited greater frequency in the use of pollutant load models and spatially explicit hydrologic and hydraulic models. Project prioritization was found to increasingly focus on feasibility to implement proposed strategies. More recent plans additionally exhibited greater consideration for water quality, ecological health, and public participation. Innovation in planning methods and consideration of future watershed conditions are primary areas that were found to be deficient in the study WMPs, although analysis methods and tools continue to improve in the wake of advancing technology and data availability. © 2019 American Water Resources Association},

Here, we investigate the resilience of urban water supply security, which is defined in terms of the services that citizens receive. The resilience of services is determined by the availability and robustness of critical system elements or “capitals” (water resources, infrastructure, finances, management efficacy, and community adaptation). We translate quantitative information about this portfolio of capitals from seven contrasting cities on four continents into parameters of a coupled system dynamics model. Water services are disrupted by recurring stochastic shocks, and we simulate the dynamics of impact and recovery cycles. Resilience emerges under various constraints, expressed in terms of each city's capital portfolio. Systematic assessment of the parameter space produces the urban water resilience landscape, and we determine the position of each city along a continuous gradient from water insecure and nonresilient to secure and resilient systems. In several cities stochastic disturbance regimes challenge steady-state conditions and drive system collapse. While water insecure and nonresilient cities risk being pushed into a poverty trap, cities which have developed excess capitals risk being trapped in rigidity and crossing a tipping point from high to low services and collapse. Where public services are insufficient, community adaptation improves water security and resilience to varying degrees. Our results highlight the need for resilience thinking in the governance of urban water systems under global change pressures. ©2019. The Authors.},

Global climate change and urban economic development exacerbate the problem of limited water supply and water shortage. In Asian arid areas, water has been being an important economic lifeline to maintain a healthy and sustainable oasis system. This study took the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in China’s north-western arid area as a typical case region, identified an analytic framework of water resource system risk (WRSR) and analysed systematically the WRSR degree from the different perspectives. The results indicated that the runoff from mountainous watershed showed an increasing trend, but the total amount of watershed water resource showed a decreasing trend in the HRB in the past 50 years. Besides serious drought risk in recent 20 years, the WRSR is mainly from excessive water use in agriculture irrigation. Overall, the WRSR has increased from the year 2000 onward and is expected to increase and fluctuate in the future. Similarly, the potential WRSR is also huge in some arid watersheds relied heavily on glacial runoff in the world. In order to reduce water scarcity risk, it is necessary to implement and carry out effectively the watershed management policies of water resource; coordinate with the balance between the river and tributaries, surface water and groundwater and water quantity and quality to ensure the reasonable water supply in the different regions and water sectors; and promote rational industry structure adjustment and the innovations and applications of water saving and conservancy science and technology. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {At times, certain areas of China suffering from water shortages. While China's government is spurring innovation and infrastructure to help head off such problems, it may be that some water conservation could help as well. It is well-known that water is embodied in traded goods—so called “virtual water trade” (VWT). In China, it seems that many water-poor areas are perversely engaged in VWT. Further, China is engaging in the global trend of fragmentation in production, even as an interregional phenomenon. Perhaps something could be learned about conserving or reducing VWT, if we knew where and how it is practiced. Given some proximate causes, perhaps viable policies could be formulated. To this end, we employ China's multiregional input-output tables straddling two periods to trace the trade of a given region's three types of goods: local final goods, local intermediate goods, and goods that shipped to other regions and countries. We find that goods traded interregionally in China in 2012 embodied 30.4\% of all water used nationwide. Nationwide, water use increased substantially over 2007–2012 due to greater shipment volumes of water-intensive products. In fact, as suspected, the rise in value chain-related trade became a major contributing factor. Coastal areas tended to be net receivers of VWT from interior provinces, although reasons differed, e.g. Shanghai received more to fulfill final demand (67.8\% of net inflow) and Zhejiang for value-chain related trade (40.2\% of net inflow). In sum, the variety of our findings reveals an urgent need to consider trade types and water scarcity when developing water resource allocation and conservation policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This article, using the concept of institutional capacity, shows that powerful efforts affecting regional water resource coordination emerge locally. The article analyses fresh water cooperation in the urban region of Cirebon, Indonesia. It is shown that the city and its surrounding regions in decentralising Indonesia show signs of increasing institutional capacity between local actors. An informal approach and discretionary local decision-making, influenced by the logic of appropriateness and tolerance, are influential. At the same time, these capacities are compromised by significant inequality and a unilateral control of water resources, and they are being challenged by a strong authoritarian political culture inherited from a history of centralised government. The article points to the need to establish greater opportunities for water governance at the regional level to transcend inter-local rivalry, and thus improve decentralised institutional capacity further. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.},

	abstract = {Climate change and growing populations will stretch water resources in many city-regions globally, and urbanisation will continue to degrade water quality and upset natural hydrological flows. These pressures call for alternative urban water management approaches with improved connection with land use planning. Evaluating the water metabolism of urban areas gives a holistic picture of how water flows through and is transformed by urban settlements, to inform land use planning for sustainably managing urban water. Previous research has conceptualised how metabolism science may inform urban land use planning. In this work, we build on to identify how urban water metabolism evaluations can inform urban planning practice. We ask, ‘how can urban water metabolism evaluations support urban and water planning towards water sensitive city-regions?’ Focusing on three Australian capital city-regions, we empirically identify the knowledge needs of practitioners and compare this against the knowledge known to be generated from past urban water metabolism evaluations. This was done within a framework of urban water resource management objectives for water sensitive cities - that is, protection of water resources and hydrological flows, recognition of the diverse functions of water, and resource efficiency and supply internalisation. Based on the findings, the paper discusses five key strategic initiatives for planning for water sensitive city-regions: resource efficiency and hydrological performance benchmarks and targets for urban developments, tailoring programmes for resource efficiency, making case for regional blue-green space networks for improved hydrological performance, small and large-scale infrastructure innovation, and social and institutional innovation in urban water management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Water infrastructure dynamics result from coupled social and physical hydrological processes embedded in “socio-hydrological systems” (SHSs). Freshwater fuels socioeconomic activity, which in turn exerts pressure on water resources through increased water demand and water quality degradation. Many factors emphasize the need for quantitative tools to predict the future of these systems, including SHS failures due to growing water scarcity from population growth and climate change. However, unfolding the interactions between social and hydrological factors continues to resist theoretical treatment, impeding progress toward a predictive framework. To resolve this issue, we propose and evaluate time delays as surrogates for the social dynamics in SHS models. This approach permits the development of models that describe SHS dynamics in terms of observable, physical, hydrological state variables. We apply this approach to two case studies: (a) reservoir storage capacity growth in the world and the U.S. Water Resources Regions and (b) global water withdrawals. Substantial variability was identified in empirical estimates of growth rates and time delays. Reservoir construction typically follows a saturating, logistic curve with periodic, punctuated equilibria, separated by delays ranging from 5 to 20 years both globally and regionally. In contrast, global water withdrawal data display faster-than-exponential growth, characteristic of a positive feedback through which water use drives further water development. Historical analysis suggests that growth trends in water resources systems are superimposed by recurring periods of innovation and inactivity which are indicative of slow memory dissipation and delayed effects of past water use on current water infrastructure decisions. ©2019.

	abstract = {Human capacity growth in knowledge and innovation is crucial if South Africa is to achieve developmental goals such as efficient, sustainable and equitable water resource management. About 80 percent of the South African population comprises socially and economically disadvantaged people, living in township areas (urban areas previously allocated to Black residents during the apartheid era) that experience low household water security and lack water-related knowledge capacity. For example, the national unemployment rate is 36.3\%, and in the region of the study, the Eastern Cape, is 44.5\%. An integrated approach to water resource management requires meaningful participation of water stakeholders in management processes. Civil society organisations championing practices to address water service delivery issues in their local communities are well placed to build their individual capacity and foster community capacity development and active citizenship around water issues. This paper explores the learning experiences of a civil society organisation, Water for Dignity (WfD), as they addressed water service delivery issues in the Makana Local Municipality, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. The learning process of the WfD group was explored through the retrospective analysis of data collected through participatory action research, at the WfD group, and wider community level. Learning within the WfD group was analysed through a communities of practice lens. Learning between WfD and the wider community was analysed through using a social learning lens. Learning at WfD team level occurred in four ways, through learning as belonging, learning as doing, learning as experiencing and learning as becoming. Social learning that occurred at a community level related mainly to personal water rights and best practices for improving water quality and water conservation. These were fostered mainly through structured citizen engagements offered by WfD. The research provides evidence that civil society organisations can play an important role in bridging water-related knowledge gaps and can foster active citizenship in South African communities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The nexus concept, which focuses on connections and trade-offs between water, energy and food sectors, has received increasing attention in academia and policy-circles. The concept has actively been examined and approached on global, national and regional scales via multiple academic studies and policy reviews. In this paper, we respond to the call of “urbanising” and “politicising” the nexus. We do so through the exploratory case-study of Amsterdam. We adopt an urban political ecology approach rooted in discussions on the concept of urban metabolism. Urban metabolism studies cities as organisms and as such is focussed on understanding the interconnections of the resource provisioning and infrastructural networks of water, energy and food. An urban political ecology approach centres on the political and economic processes at play in shaping how these interconnections take form in the metabolism of a city. In drawing on insights from both political ecology and urban metabolism, we study who drives the connections between water, energy and food sectors in Amsterdam, who gets excluded, and how the process takes place. We show how the cooperation between the main water and energy companies makes the “water-energy” connections the most well-established in Amsterdam, whereas the role of food, particularly in the form of urban agricultural activities, remains more obscure. Moreover, as opposed to the search for the nexus leading to a more radical transformation of infrastructural networks of provisioning of water, energy and food and their connections, we argue that the nexus in Amsterdam is largely defined by efficiency discourses, technological innovation and market-based solutions that stay within the context of existing infrastructures and embedded ways of provisioning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Unfortunately, their adoption has been limited. This study tested a conceptual model for technology adoption based on the Theory of Diffusion of Innovations in tandem with Adaption-Innovation Theory and Critical Thinking Style literature. Using a series of linear and logistic regressions, three characteristics of an innovation-relative advantage, complexity, and trialability-were identified as significant drivers of growers' decisions to implement water treatment technologies. Growers who seek information when thinking critically and are more innovative when solving problems did not perceive new technologies to be compatible or to possess a relative advantage over their current systems. The results suggested most growers are unsure of how new technologies fit into their existing operations. Creating opportunities for growers to get hands on experience with new technologies, such as a field day, could assist in increasing growers' implementation. In addition, developing a series of online videos highlighting how to use, adapt and troubleshoot the equipment would greatly enhance chances of long-term adoption. © 2019 by the authors.},

Since 2014, the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Testing Facility has hosted training events focused on disseminating results of innovative construction stormwater research to practitioners to help close the gap between research results and implementation. The purpose of training is to provide participants with the opportunity to learn about various practices used in construction settings to manage stormwater runoff. The result is increased knowledge of stormwater management which will translate into better protection of water resources. The facility has the unique capability of producing flows to simulate runofftypical of construction activities using research apparatuses, allowing attendees to understand how devices react when subject to field-like runoffconditions. The facility has provided training through a total of nine offerings with 764 participants. The purpose of this manuscript is to evaluate the effectiveness of the delivery style of these courses in providing technology transfer to industry professionals. In distributed surveys, attendees were asked to rank their level of knowledge prior to and after attending the training programs in ten specific focus areas covered during training. Overall, knowledge measurements indicated that technical knowledge level was improved across all measured areas with an average increase in perceived knowledge of 82\% for a 1.5-day hands-on installer training event and 36\% for a 1-day field day. © 2019 by the authors.},

Rainfall is a key component of the water cycle and its variability can profoundly influence agriculture, ecosystems and water resource management. In this paper, an innovative trend analysis (ITA) method with a significant test is used for rainfall trend detection at 14 stations in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) during 1961–2016. The trends are separately evaluated for low ({\textless}10th percentile), medium (10th–90th percentile) and high ({\textgreater}90th percentile) rainfall at the annual and seasonal scales. The slope and significance of the rainfall trends derived from the ITA method are compared with those from the classical trend analysis methods Theil-Sen approach and Mann-Kendall test, respectively. The ITA shows significant increasing trends at the 99\% confidence level in annual rainfall at all stations. While the same significant increasing trends are identified for summer and winter, decreasing trends dominate in spring and autumn. Contrasting trends are found for extreme rainfall with strong increasing trends in high rainfall in summer and winter and decreasing trends in low rainfall in spring and autumn. The results of the ITA confirmed by the classical trend analysis methods call for more attention to the risk management of flood in extreme seasons and drought in transitional seasons across the YRD region. © 2019},

	abstract = {The systematic review (SR) is a methodology used to find and aggregate all relevant existing evidence about a specific research question of interest. One of the activities associated with the SR process is the selection of primary studies, which is a time consuming manual task. The quality of primary study selection impacts the overall quality of SR. The goal of this paper is to propose a strategy named “Score Citation Automatic Selection” (SCAS), to automate part of the primary study selection activity. The SCAS strategy combines two different features, content and citation relationships between the studies, to make the selection activity as automated as possible. Aiming to evaluate the feasibility of our strategy, we conducted an exploratory case study to compare the accuracy of selecting primary studies manually and using the SCAS strategy. The case study shows that for three SRs published in the literature and previously conducted in a manual implementation, the average effort reduction was 58.2 \% when applying the SCAS strategy to automate part of the initial selection of primary studies, and the percentage error was 12.98 \%. Our case study provided confidence in our strategy, and suggested that it can reduce the effort required to select the primary studies without adversely affecting the overall results of SR.},

Firstly, the original scale was translated, adapted, expanded and evaluated by a panel of five experts. Then it was tested by evaluating a random sample of five systematic reviews by three judges with no formal training in the scale. Finally, the consolidated scale was assessed in a new panel by two judges. The panel of experts reached a consensus regarding the validity of the proposed changes. With respect to the scale total and per item score, the average agreement between judges was considered satisfactory in the consolidated scale. From the processes of adaptation and validation performed, the methodology in its final version consisted of 14 items that taken together indicate the methodological quality of systematic reviews from different areas of knowledge.},

	abstract = {La mangrove est un écosystème complexe qui se développe sur les zones intertidales, le long des littoraux (sub)tropicaux. Dû à sa production primaire élevée, couplée à une grande capacité de séquestration du carbone organique, la mangrove a été nommée écosystème à « Carbone Bleu ». Toutefois, le changement climatique à venir, et particulièrement les augmentations en CO2 atmosphérique et en température ainsi que la hausse du niveau marin, pourraient modifier son fonctionnement. Dans de ce contexte, les objectifs étaient de (i) comprendre comment les variations eustatiques passées ont pu impacter les stocks de carbone enfouis dans les sols de mangrove, afin de mieux prévoir l’effet de la future hausse du niveau marin, (ii) caractériser les émissions de CO2 et de CH4 depuis les sols et la colonne d’eau dans la mangrove, et (iii) évaluer l’impact de la hausse des concentrations en CO2 atmosphérique et de la durée d’immersion sur la physiologie de plantules de palétuviers. L’augmentation des concentrations CO2 atmosphérique modifiera la productivité des palétuviers, notamment en stimulant leur activité photosynthétique, facilitant ainsi leurs capacités à coloniser de nouveaux espaces disponibles du fait de la hausse des océans. Cette hausse aura également un effet conséquent sur les stocks de carbone dans les sols, comme nous l’avons montré pour les variations eustatiques de l’Holocène tardif, impliquant également une migration des strates de mangrove. Finalement, les émissions de CO2 et de CH4 vers l’atmosphère sont non négligeables, tout particulièrement celles émises depuis la colonne d’eau, qui devront être pris en compte dans les futurs bilans carbone de l’écosystème.},

	abstract = {Abstract Global climate change is affecting carbon cycling by driving changes in primary productivity and rates of carbon fixation, release and storage within Earth's vegetated systems. There is, however, limited understanding of how carbon flow between donor and recipient habitats will respond to climatic changes. Macroalgal-dominated habitats, such as kelp forests, are gaining recognition as important carbon donors within coastal carbon cycles, yet rates of carbon assimilation and transfer through these habitats are poorly resolved. Here, we investigated the likely impacts of ocean warming on coastal carbon cycling by quantifying rates of carbon assimilation and transfer in Laminaria hyperborea kelp forests?one of the most extensive coastal vegetated habitat types in the NE Atlantic?along a latitudinal temperature gradient. Kelp forests within warm climatic regimes assimilated, on average, more than three times less carbon and donated less than half the amount of particulate carbon compared to those from cold regimes. These patterns were not related to variability in other environmental parameters. Across their wider geographical distribution, plants exhibited reduced sizes toward their warm-water equatorward range edge, further suggesting that carbon flow is reduced under warmer climates. Overall, we estimated that Laminaria hyperborea forests stored {\textasciitilde}11.49 Tg C in living biomass and released particulate carbon at a rate of {\textasciitilde}5.71 Tg C year?1. This estimated flow of carbon was markedly higher than reported values for most other marine and terrestrial vegetated habitat types in Europe. Together, our observations suggest that continued warming will diminish the amount of carbon that is assimilated and transported through temperate kelp forests in NE Atlantic, with potential consequences for the coastal carbon cycle. Our findings underline the need to consider climate-driven changes in the capacity of ecosystems to fix and donate carbon when assessing the impacts of climate change on carbon cycling.},

	abstract = {The hydrology of coastal lakes differs significantly from that of inland water bodies due to the influence of the neighboring sea. Observed climatic changes are expected to enhance the effect of the sea on coastal lake ecosystems, which makes research on sea\&ndash;lake interactions even more significant. In this study, on the basis of maximum annual and monthly values of water level, dependencies among the water levels of six lakes located along the southern coast of the Baltic Sea in Poland, and the Baltic Sea water levels were analyzed. First, the Spearman rank correlation and the linear regression method were applied. Then, selected copulas were used to find joint distributions of the studied time series. In the next stage, the degrees of synchronous and asynchronous occurrences of maximum water levels in lakes and the sea were calculated. The study revealed that correlations between the maximum annual water levels in coastal lakes and in the Baltic Sea in the selected gauge stations were very strong and statistically significant. These results were confirmed by a synchronicity analysis carried out with the help of a copula function. The highest relationship was detected in the case of Lake Resko Przymorskie (correlation coefficient 0.86, synchronicity 75.18\%), while the lowest were observed in Lakes Jamno (0.62 and 58.20\%, respectively) and Bukowo (0.60 and 56.82\%, respectively). The relation strength between maximum water levels of the sea and coastal lakes may increase in the future due to sea level rises caused by climate warming.},

	abstract = {Motility evaluation is a necessary step in semen analysis by artificial insemination centres, once it can be related to sperm fertility; a widespread method to evaluate spermatozoa progressive movement and velocity is light microscopy (LM). Limitations of the routine methods unfolded new approaches of evaluations mainly in optical branches. The incidence of laser light on specimens exhibiting biological activity generates an interference image named biospeckle which has been used to investigate biological activity such as in plants, animals and human beings. The aim of this work was to evaluate frozen semen kinetics of bovine species, comparing LM with biospeckle analysis. Thirty straws were thawed and semen was illuminated by He-Ne laser just after LM evaluation. Biospeckle images were processed using a second order statistical approach obtaining a summary value named inertial moment (IM). Data were statistically analyzed using Spearman correlation and box plots. IM approach was correlated (r=0.904) to sperm cell velocity (p{\textless}0.0001). In addition, percent sperm cell motility and mobile sperm cell concentration presented positive correlation (r=0.977; r=0.815; respectively, p{\textless}0.0001), evidencing coherence between semen activity features and IM values. Sperm cell concentration did not influenced IM values (r=0.262; p{\textgreater}0.05). These data indicate that biospeckle laser system should be considered a reliable tool for semen motility assessment contributing as an alternative method to sperm cell fertility investigation.},

	abstract = {Gully erosion is the destructive and dramatic form of land degradation in Northeast China. The region is the grain production and ecological security base of China where the fertile and productive Mollisols are distributed. Though the region was agriculturally developed relatively recently, it went through high intensity cultivation and fast succession processes within short-time scales. Coupled with irrational farming practice choice and land use, hillslope erosion and gully erosion are seriously threatening agricultural production and environmental stability in the region. The awareness of gully erosion by the local governments started in the 1970s, and conservation measures were thus implemented. In this paper, based on our survey, communications with local farmers and stakeholders as well as investigation for gully erosion for the past three years, we summarize the practical and efficient practices to manage gully erosion developed by researchers and farmers in Northeast China during the past 50 years. These practices include various drop structures, soil check dams, masonry check dams, gabion check dams, wicker check dams, continuous live wicker, a shrub plant enclosure, and an arbor plant enclosure. We specifically expound how a gully erosion practice is set up and identify the site conditions for which they are well-suited. The application of these practices depends on topography, gully size, and local economy. Bioengineering techniques in Northeast China, such as continuous live wicker, a shrub plant enclosure, and an arbor plant enclosure, are highly effective in controlling gully erosion. Problems and challenges are also presented.},

	abstract = {Mountain environments play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity despite becoming more vulnerable to colluvial processes primarily induced by extreme meteorological events. Soil bioengineering stabilizes mountain slopes and limits impacts on ecosystems and is increasingly used worldwide, yet its effectiveness requires better assessment through post-intervention environmental monitoring. However such studies are only rarely performed even though they are essential to improve future intervention. This study reports soil and vegetation monitoring data of an area in the Italian Alps in which soil bioengineering work was carried out to restore an area hit by landslides. The monitoring involved an analysis of the floristic-vegetational and ecological features of the plant communities of the area of the soil bioengineering intervention (and in adjacent areas), as well as an analysis of the chemical–physical characteristics of the soils (texture, pH, organic matter, nitrogen content, roots depth) where these communities were established. The results of the monitoring, analyzed in the overall framework of the state of the art of the sector, have highlighted some lines of research and action that should be undertaken by technicians, researchers, and politicians to innovate and to make work aimed at the stabilization of landslides more effective. In particular, it would be extremely useful to study the biotechnical characteristics of herbaceous plants that are still “unknown” in soil bioengineering and to evaluate their possible effects on ecosystems in order to produce seed mixtures that, besides being useful for soil stabilization, can accelerate vegetation dynamics, therefore maximizing the success of such works.},

	abstract = {Bioengineering approaches provide cost-effective ways to protect slopes against surface erosion and shallow mass movements. Indeed, vegetation is an excellent way to control slope erosion and instability of slopes. Plants play an active role both on the surface, protecting and holding soil particles, and at deeper layers, reducing pore pressure and increasing soil shear strength. The use of vegetation is particularly appropriate where soil conservation measures are needed. In the paper, a series of laboratory tests are described, together with the equipment used, to better understand plant root effects on soil shear strength and slope stability. Two species of Mediterranean plants, such as Asparagus acutifolius and Spartium junceum, were tested in the laboratory. More than 170 tensile tests have been performed on dry and saturated samples. In order to evaluate the effect of soil moisture, most several roots were also tested at different saturation ratios. Laboratory tests also included direct shear tests on root-reinforced and unreinforced samples. Comparison between reinforced and non-reinforced samples confirms the contribution of roots to improve the soil strength.},

O presente momento não só permite, mas também exige a sistematização das reflexões conceituais efetuadas e o alinhamento das experiências de empresas brasileiras com essas reflexões, analisando a capacidade explicativa da realidade organizacional pelos conceitos, a possibilidade de criação de instrumentos de gestão a partir dos conceitos e suas limitações, os equívocos e os futuros desdobramentos da gestão de pessoas em empresas consideradas modernas por suas políticas e práticas. Nesse contexto se insere este livro. SEu objetivo é traduzir duas décadas de experiências vivenciadas em conceitos que expliquem a realidade das empresas e sinalizem o futuro da gestão de pessoas e ferramentas que nos permitam agir com maior precisão no gerenciamento de pessoas. A experiência do autor - concretizada na intervenção em várias empresas nacionais e multinacionais -, tanto na concepção e implementação de sistemas de gestão de pessoas, quanto na adaptação de estruturas globais de gestão de pessoas para a realidade brasileira, permite confirmar a adequação dos conceitos aqui tratados e sua transformação em instrumentos de gestão. Este livro se propõe a sistematizar um conjunto de experiências, pesquisas e contribuições desenvolvidas ao longo dos últimos vinte anos, na busca de um modelo de gestão que atenda às necessidades da empresa moderna. Livro-texto para disciplinas sobre gestão de pessoas e gestão por competência de cursos de Administração em nível de graduação e pós-graduação ou de MBAs executivos. INdicado para profissionais envolvidos na gestão de pessoas e/ou em posição de liderança em empresas modernas.},

Para realizar essa revisão temática, foi definido como assunto da pesquisa e por consequência palavras chaves: empreendedorismo; desenvolvimento local; sustentabilidade. O período de pesquisa foi entre dezembro de 2014 à fevereiro de 2015. Os sites de busca foram: http://www.teses.usp.br; http://www.periodicos.capes.gov.br; http://www.scielo.br; http://scholar.google.com.br; http://ciencia.science.gov; http://www.sciencedirect.com; http://bdtd.ibict.br; http://eric.ed.gov/. Como resultado encontrado observou-se que no alcance desse modelo sustentável, não apenas novos padrões de produção e distribuição de bens e serviços e do uso dos recursos naturais devem ser almejados, mas necessita-se também repensar os padrões de consumo das próprias pessoas. Não só o esforço das organizações que desenvolvem e oferecem seus produtos e serviços sociais, mas também um posicionamento firme do poder público. Apoiar, capacitar, acompanhar e financiar a geração atual e futura dos empreendedores sociais e privados é crucial para se aumentar o estoque de Capital Social local. Pode-se concluir que a participação civil na criação e condução de projetos ou empreendimentos sociais é elemento fundamental na geração de capital social que só se concretiza na existência de capital humano ou, em última análise, com a participação de empreendedores privados e sociais. Nessa perspectiva a Educação Empreendedora pode trazer uma grande contribuição para a construção de uma sociedade economicamente viável, ambientalmente correta e socialmente justa.},

	abstract = {O interesse no empreendedorismo está explodindo globalmente, embora muitos acreditem que ele não pode ser ensinado — que as pessoas que se tornam bem-sucedidas nasceram com algo a mais. Mas os maiores empreendedores — Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates e todos os outros — na verdade tinham apenas um ponto em comum: criaram ótimos produtos. Empreendedorismo Disciplinado oferece uma abordagem passo a passo completa, integrada e comprovada para criar produtos inovadores e altamente bem-sucedidos. Foca o processo iterativo que o leva a uma solução excelente e aprimorada — a base para toda empresa. Independentemente de o seu negócio se concentrar em desenvolver um produto físico, serviço ou disponibilizar informações, Empreendedorismo Disciplinado divide os processos necessários em 24 Etapas que qualquer pessoa dedicada pode aprender. Sim, o empreendedorismo pode ser caótico; mas as variáveis, intrinsecamente imprevisíveis, requerem uma estrutura sistemática que lhe permita reduzir o risco, identificando e esquematizando as áreas controláveis. O processo descrito neste livro pode garantir o sucesso — ou levá-lo a fracassar mais rapidamente, caso a falha seja inevitável, e direcioná-lo a uma ideia melhor. Este guia simplificado para começar um novo empreendimento mostra como: Criar um valor específico concentrado em uma oportunidade de mercado que você pode dominar Quantificar o valor único que você oferece ao cliente-alvo — e como traduzi-lo em lucro Planejar e criar seu produto do modo mais eficiente possível Superar os obstáculos comuns ao fazer com que seu produto seja adotado pelos clientes Identificar e testar as principais hipóteses E muito mais! Conforme o mundo se torna mais complexo e os problemas, mais urgentes, a necessidade de empreendedores só aumenta. Este guia capacitará os empresários destemidos a buscar melhores soluções de forma rápida e eficiente. Se você é um empreendedor novato ou experiente, Empreendedorismo Disciplinado oferece as ferramentas fundamentais para melhorar suas chances de criar um produto que as pessoas desejam — e precisam — ter.},

	abstract = {The São Francisco River Basin has been submitted to strong environmental impacts through changes in the hydrologic and sedimentological regime, and also the ongoing destruction of its riparian vegetation. The riparian vegetation has an important role on the riverbank's protection, through the roots system and the plant cover, improving the soil particles aggregation in a low cohesion situation, reducing the runoff and resulting in a lower erosion rate and sedimentation of the river channel. The objective of study was to evaluate the initial development of forest species at riverbank under soil bioengineering technique in São Francisco River. The soil bioengineering technique was composed of longitudinal slope covered with the biotextile (Fibrax 400 BF) and sediment retainers (Bemalonga® D40), to reduce the impact of wave water at the slope botton, avoiding the bank undercutting, due to daily variations of water level. Before the biotextile installation the specie, Brachiaria decumbens was sown to promote rapid cover vegetation. Six forest native species such as aroeira vermelha (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi.), pau pombo (Tapirira guianensis Aubl.) mulungu (Erythrina velutina Willd.) tamboril (Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vellozo) Morong), canafístula (Cassia grandis Lf) and pau-ferro (Caesalpinia leiostachya (Bentham) Ducke) were planted. The species developments were analyzed through the Relative Growth Rate (RGR) of the shoot height and crown diameter. After 6 (six) months, by the end of evaluations, the bigger number of live individuals was identified in the soil bioengineering treatment. The high density and strong growth of Brachiaria decumbens in the area with biotextile, have contributed to the lower initial tree seedlings development.},

	abstract = {Referring to the Institutionalist debate in economics, the article discusses institutional arrangements in the Amazon taking into account the structural diversity that characterizes the rural sector in the region. Based on the different patterns of relationships between technological trajectories, two large representative configurations of development conditions are established: i) rural economies based on agriculture and livestock, and ii) economies based on agroforestry systems. Comparing the results of agricultural censuses of 1995 and 2006 one finds, for each case, structural changes in the period and speed, fundamentals and impacts of growth are analyzed. Special attention is given to the institutional foundations of the processes. As a result, two large institutional arrangements are presented, one that has the “land market”, and another that has the rules of access to common resources of biomes and ecosystems as its core foundation. Formal institutional mechanisms operate in each territory and interact with these informal institutions, and that characterizes the prevailing territorial governance. As a conclusion, it is found that a practical implication of it is that development policies based on sustainability should seriously consider these distinctions.},

	abstract = {More than 3000 commercial vessels navigate through the Malamocco-Marghera Industrial Canal in Venice Lagoon, Italy in a given year, leading to an estimated annual resuspension of 1.2 × 106 metric tons of sediment. Hence, ship wakes contribute to the significant erosion of shoals in the central lagoon which has occurred over the last 30 years. Drawdown associated with the surface depression wave from successive ships induces sediment transport towards the shipping canal, where the cost of dredging amounts to tens of millions of Euro per year. Most ship traffic occurs near an industrial zone, resulting in substantial potential for resuspension of contaminated sediment. Thus, sediment resuspension by ship traffic in the Venice Lagoon has the potential for detrimental economic and environmental impacts. This paper illustrates the impacts of ship induced depression waves and discusses management options for mitigating those impacts, based on extensive observational data and analysis conducted in Venice Lagoon, Italy. This article helps to further the understanding of the processes that govern sediment transport along the shipping channel and employ this knowledge to develop specific management recommendations. A reduction in the navigation speed of ships, an increase in the distance between successive ships, and limiting navigation to tidal levels above 0.3 m from the local 1897 reference mean sea level can help to minimize these problems.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMOS31B..03P},
	abstract = {The Lagrangian transport due to breaking deep water surface gravity waves is examined using theoretical, numerical, and observational studies. First, a theoretical criterion for particles to surf an underlying surface gravity wave is presented. It is found that particles traveling near the phase speed of an underlying wave, in a geometrically confined region on the forward face of the crest, increase in speed. Next, this theory is employed to study the Lagrangian transport due to non-breaking and breaking waves. Direct numerical simulations of focusing wave packets are presented, and it is found that breaking may enhance drift by up to an order of magnitude, compared to the classical Stokes drift prediction. A simple scaling argument implies that the drift due to breaking is proportional to a measure of the slope of the waves as compared to the unbroken Stokes drift which scales with the slope squared, where this measure of the slope is always less than 1. Finally, this model is combined with ocean field data of breaking wave statistics to estimate the Lagrangian drift due to breaking. This is compared with the classical prediction of Stokes drift, and it is found that breaking may provide a significant contribution to the wave induced mass transport. Implications for a better description of upper ocean processes are discussed.},

Essas disciplinas são normalmente fornecidas aos engenheirandos das diversas modalidades de forma separada e, muitas vezes, sem a preocupação de se mostrar a conexão e continuidade do assunto entre si. Assim, por exemplo, o aluno do curso de engenharia recebe uma formação introdutória de termodinâmica e não lhe é informado que as leis de conservação que regem este campo são também as mesmas que regem a área de mecânica dos fluidos e transferência de calor, excluída a ênfase de cada disciplina. Às vezes, ainda se acrescem às dificuldades a adversidade de terminologia e as diferenças de peculiaridades de notação. Para preencher essas dificuldades, o presente livro procura apresentar as três disciplinas de forma integrada e com senso de continuidade e interrelacionamento. O livro é dirigido primordialmente aos alunos das diversas modalidades de engenharia, exceto engenharia mecânica. Os assuntos tratados são apresentados de forma concisa, porém não superficial.

There is a need to better understand which individual- and contextual-level factors are related to engineering students' entrepreneurial intentions. Purpose/Hypothesis This study explores individual and contextual predictors of entrepreneurial intent among undergraduate women and men in engineering and business majors. Entrepreneurial intent is defined as the personal importance that students ascribe to starting a new business or organization. Design/Method The participants included 518 engineering and 471 business undergraduates from 51 U.S. colleges and universities. We examined relationships first by discipline and then by gender in each discipline using regression models with interaction terms. Results Innovation orientation and participation in entrepreneurship activities tied to intent more strongly for engineering students than for business students; in contrast, being at a research institution and selection of novel goals tied to intent more strongly for business students than for their engineering peers. Among engineering students only, being able to switch gears and apply alternative means for reaching one's goal in the face of setbacks was positively related with women's entrepreneurial intent but not with men's. Conclusions Entrepreneurial intent is a function of individual-level characteristics and academic and social contexts, with some degree of discipline-specific effects. Diversifying the community of aspiring engineering entrepreneurs is a critical issue that merits attention by the engineering education community.},

	abstract = {The importance of linking efficiently the outputs of R\&D processes with the business world has become evident. Researchers and practitioners have developed tools to help build business from a starting point (business idea/product concept) to the description of elements that make the business possible. The Business Model Canvas identifies the essential parts of a business; it's applicability and simplicity has given it greater acceptance and dissemination. Furthermore, the Technology Roadmap is presented as a valuable tool to visualize the relationships over time of the market, technology and product strategies; TRMs allow decision makers to identify gaps between the current and the future business strategy. BMC and TRMs have been used independently of each other. This work has the objective to present a methodology of the building process integration of these two tools, to provide a business model and a technology roadmap for the business idea or new product concept that are aligned to the current and future business needs. Then, it is explained and described in a practical manner by a case of study. One of the benefits of using this methodology is that a business constructs a BMC and TRM with two different approaches giving the process the perspective of future analysis and also visualizing elements for the current business. It was found that the building integration process allows constructing a robust business strategy proposal in a structured mode taking into account the benefits of each tool and reducing the disadvantages.},

This change of activity from tasks inside the nest to tasks outside the nest took place between day 13 and 25 after adult moult for major and between day 9 and 32 after adult moult for minor workers. The overall activity to the foraging arena revealed a clear 24-h rhythm, with the highest activity in the evening at 20:00 h and the lowest activity in the morning at 7:00 h.},

	abstract = {Termites are social insects with 2800 described species which feeds on cellulose in different stages of decomposition. Based on the proportion of organic matter found in there gut content they are classified in four feeding groups: group I (not Termitidae), dead wood and grass feeders; group II, Termitidae that feeds on same food source that of the group I; group III, which feed on decomposed wood and organic matter rich soil; group IV, true soil feeders. The foraging activity is subject to a trade-off: the adverse weather conditions of the dry season impose physiological limits, but the colonies need a large quantity of food during this season to meet the needs of alates production for the next swarming period. The objective was to verify if the termite community in an area of forest and savannah of the Cerrados presents changes in the activity of foraging between the dry and wet season of 2007. The study was conducted in the municipality of Hidrolândia-GO at RPPN "Banana Menina" (16º57"44'S and 49º13"41'O). The climate of the region is the type Aw of Köppen. Six grids with 20 baits consisting of a roll of toilet paper away from adjacents 1m and buried at a depth average of 3cm were mounted in the two physiognomic forms. Each grid was placed at a distance of at least 100 m from the others. The collections were made on Sundays during two months after the baits installation, totaling eight collections each season (July and August in the dry season and November and December in the wet season). It was found 28 species of termites, 24 in the dry season, of which 11 in the forest physiognomy and 16 in the savannah. In the period of rain, 19 species were sampled, with 11 at the forest and 11 at the savannah. All feeding groups were collected in all seasons and physiognomies, with the exception of group IV, which occurred only in the savannah. Group II was the richest with 13 species and group I, even showing the slightest specie richness (3 species), occupied the largest number of baits (47.6 and 10.25 in the rain and the dry seasons respectively).Considering the entire termite community a significant increase in the number of baits attacked in the rainy season was verified and this trend was similar in both physiognomies. Only the group I has show a significant difference in the number of baits occupied between the two sample period, with no interaction between physiognomy and season. The most abundant species were Heterotermes tenuis (feeding group I) and Velocitermes velox (feeding group II), present in both physiognomies, Cornitermes snyderi (feeding group II) and Nasutitermes cf. jaraguae (feeding group II), present only in the savannah and Neocapritermes opacus (food group III) and Heterotermes longiceps (food group I) present only in the forest. N. opacus and C. snyderi increased significantly the number of baits occupied in the rainy season. The other species did not show any change. The activity of foraging termites in the area of studies presented a peak during the rain season. The colonies are subject to different pressures due to its characteristics as period of swarm, population dynamics, body size, feeding group and type and location of nesting and foraging.},

	abstract = {Aggressive behaviour can ensure animals access to local resources contributing to fitness increment. To 
reduce constant costs in the defence of territories, individuals could save energy with conflicts avoiding 
aggression with neighbour (Dear Enemy Hypothesis). This reduction in aggressiveness can be 
determined by the increase of encounters and consequently odor habituation among neighbours. Social 
insects have an efficient recognition system that guarantees social cohesion and protection against 
intruders in their colonies and territories. Here, we analysed the effect of distance among colonies and 
resource availability on the aggression level and responses to chemical cues of Nasutitermes aff. 
coxipoensis (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae). We also tested if this pattern could be promoted by previous 
exposure to intercolonial odors and the type of resource consumed. Manipulation of resource offer was 
conducted in the field during three months, where nests with different distances were kept without 
addition of baits (control), with addition of three or 16 sugarcane baits/nest. Bioassays of aggressiveness, 
linear and Y-shaped trail following bioassays were carried out with all pairwise combinations of colonies 
in each treatment. The effect of previous exposure to intercolonial odor and the consumption of similar 
resources on aggressive behavior and choice of intercolonial cues was tested in laboratory conditions. 
Our results showed individuals from colonies with 0 and 3 baits/nest showed a higher number of fighting 
with neighbours than those from non-neighbours colonies. Termite workers from colonies without baits 
(control) followed shorter distance in the linear trails compared to those from colonies with addition of 
baits. Intercolonial aggressiveness was not affected by previous exposure to intercolonial odor and 
neither by the consumption of similar resources. However, individuals previously exposed to 
intercolonial odor were more attracted to these odors than individuals who had no prior exposure. In 
addition, individuals from colonies of N. aff. coxipoensis that use similar resources increased the number 
of vibration than individuals who consumed different food resources. We concluded that the response 
of intercolonial aggressiveness in N. aff. coxipoensis seems to be resource-dependent. These results may 
contribute to the comprehension of the use of space by N. aff. coxipoensis and could be useful to explain 
patterns of termite species co-occurrence at natural conditions.},

	abstract = {The oceanic connection between the coastal variability along the southwestern African coasts and the linear equatorial dynamics at subseasonal time-scales ({\textless}120 days) is examined using a variety of model outputs, ranging from linear to general circulation models. We focus on the equatorially-forced fast and weakly dissipative first-mode coastal trapped waves which are shown to propagate down to the southern tip of Africa. In the eastern equatorial Atlantic, the first-mode equatorial forcing is tangled with the higher-order Kelvin wave modes and is overshadowed by the dominant second baroclinic mode. The latter is slower and peaks 10 days after the concealed first-mode contribution. Within this time frame, the remotely-forced first-mode coastal trapped waves impinge on the variability of the Benguela upwelling ecosystem, almost in phase with the subseasonal sea level fluctuations in the Gulf of Guinea. Over 1993–2008, the equatorial forcing undergoes a substantial interannual modulation. Periods of energetic first-mode equatorial Kelvin waves coincide with a strong subseasonal coastal wind activity that breaks the stronger equatorial connection. This suggests the existence of a large-scale atmospheric connection between the equatorial wave forcing and the along-shore winds in the Benguela, modulating the maximum latitude at which the equatorial dynamics impacts the local marine resources.},

	abstract = {Studies show that climate variability drives interannual changes in meteorological variables in Europe, which directly or indirectly impacts crop production. However, there is no climate-based decision model that uses indices of atmospheric oscillation to predict agricultural production risks in Europe on multiple time-scales during the growing season. We used Fast-and-Frugal trees to predict sugar beet production, applying five large-scale indices of atmospheric oscillation: El Niño Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Scandinavian Pattern, East Atlantic Pattern, and East Atlantic/West Russian pattern. We found that Fast-and-Frugal trees predicted high/low sugar beet production events in 77\% of the investigated regions, corresponding to 81\% of total European sugar beet production. For nearly half of these regions, high/low production could be predicted six or five months before the start of the sugar beet harvesting season, which represents approximately 44\% of the mean annual sugar beet produced in all investigated areas. Providing early warning of crop production shortages/excess allows decision makers to prepare in advance. Therefore, the use of the indices of climate variability to forecast crop production is a promising tool to strengthen European agricultural climate resilience.},

At the first step, the effect of the first layer thickness of geotextile, the width of geotextile, as well as vertical spacing and number of geotextile layers on the bearing capacity of footings were investigated. As a result, the experimental results comprehensively exhibited that nonwoven geotextiles increase the bearing capacity of footings in all cases. It was found that the optimum values of vertical spaces between geotextile layers with different distances from the upper layer are ranging from 0.3 to 0.4B. Additionally, the results suggested that the bearing capacity ratio increases gradually with the increase in the relative density.},

Regarding the physical model using a wave generation system, the data collected and the test conditions were addressed considering different scenarios (return periods of 20, 50 and 100 years). It was found that for return periods of 20 years, the behavior of the infrastructure as a whole was stable. For return periods of 50 years, wave overtopping became more frequent and intense, and began to impact the superstructure. For the 100-year return period the behavior of the infrastructure was found to be unstable, with persistent wave overtopping. The morphology of the submerged layers also changed. The main objectives of the numerical model approach were to estimate the natural frequencies of vibration (when materials suffer a considerable modification, a change in their frequencies of vibration can be detected), and to calculate the expected displacements corresponding to cruise ship docking processes (agitation in a protected area) and the associated maximum maritime (agitation in an exposed area) forces. The maximum displacements obtained for the two cases were about 0.03 m, which is a high value. Considering the results obtained from this work, the Port authorities decided to maintain the monitoring program and perform an underwater video inspection.},

Observations of internal wave–induced sediment resuspension and transport cover significant portions of the world's oceans. Research on BBL instabilities, induced by internal waves, has identified several mechanisms by which the BBL is energized and sediment may be resuspended. Due to the complexity of the induced currents, process-oriented research using theory, direct numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments has played a vital role. However, experiments and simulations have inherent limitations as analogs for oceanic conditions due to disparities in Reynolds number and grid resolution, respectively. Parameterizations are needed for modeling resuspension from observed data and in larger-scale models, with the efficacy of parameterizations based on the quadratic stress largely determining the accuracy of present field-scale efforts.},

The present work comprises an historic time evaluation of this phenomenon based on the analysis of the sediment dispersion patterns caused by waves along three distinct shoreline traces. For this, we define a wave climate model based on the construction of refraction diagrams, which are assumed to be valid for the three shorelines. The resulting sediment transport patterns obtained by numerical modeling from the refraction diagrams—taking into account the angle of approach and the wave height along the coast—allow us to establish a first-order correlation between coastal dynamics and erosion phenomenon. The results also suggest that a permanent reduction in the solid river discharge, in response to the construction of large dams, probably will have two direct consequences in the river mouth region: (i) a chronic shoreline erosion downdrift of the mouth and (ii) a progressive deflection of the mouth in the downdrift direction.},

	abstract = {AbstratoOs recifes de ostras construídos (CORs) fornecem proteções e habitats em terra para comunidades de peixes e moluscos através da atenuação da energia das ondas. No entanto, os processos e o mecanismo dos CRs na atenuação das ondas permanecem obscuros, limitando assim a avaliação eficaz dos CRs para a proteção da linha costeira. Este artigo apresenta os resultados de uma investigação de campo sobre as características das ondas e as variações espectrais das ondas ao longo de uma costa com CORs em um estuário com uma grande faixa de marés, assim como grandes ondas de vento e energia das ondas. Seis transdutores de pressão foram implantados de 31 de janeiro a 2 de abril de 2018, em Gandy's Beach, Nova Jersey, na parte superior da baía de Delaware. Os CRs foram construídos no local do estudo em 2016 como estruturas vivas da costa após o furacão Sandy. Os dados coletados no local do estudo exibem as variações de ondas e as características espectrais ao longo de 2 meses, incluindo quatro tempestades de inverno (ou seja, nor'easters). As variações espaciais das alturas das ondas medidas em ambos os lados dos CORs mostram uma forte dependência da razão entre o bordo livre dos CORs e as alturas das ondas offshore. Devido à grande amplitude de maré ({\textgreater} 2 m), as cristas dos CRs permanecem submersas em 85\% das vezes. Os CORs submersos fornecem apenas atenuação parcial da energia das ondas. O ambiente das ondas no estuário é complexo, especialmente durante nor'easters. Por exemplo, ventos com busca rápida de mudanças podem levar a mares eólicos bimodais. Devido aos complexos espectros de ondas, as alturas das ondas em massa, como as alturas significativas das ondas, não podem ser adotadas para revelar adequadamente a capacidade dos CRs de atenuar a energia das ondas. A análise espectral é conduzida para investigar as variações espaciais e temporais da energia das ondas em caixas de frequências direcionadas. Os resultados da análise espectral revelam a transferência de energia das ondas primárias para os altos harmônicos depois que as ondas se propagam sobre os CORs submersos. Além disso, verificou-se que a energia das ondas originárias do Oceano Atlântico pode penetrar nos CRs sem amortecimento, mesmo quando emergentes. Este estudo pode ajudar os gerentes de recursos a avaliar em profundidade a eficácia da linha costeira viva e melhorar as estruturas da linha costeira viva, como os CRs.},

However, when the surface tension is accounted for, the wave pattern is greatly modified especially at a low translating speed. Besides the minimum speed of capillary waves cmin = 0.23 m/s below which waves cannot be generated, there is another critical speed cdiv = 0.45 m/s associated with the disappearance of divergent waves.

In the laboratory experiments, fluid velocities, pressure and water surface elevations were measured. Experiments were conducted for both spilling and plunging breakers and for gravel slopes with different gravel sizes. Since gravel slopes caused additional energy dissipation, wave heights in the shoaling zone as well as at the breaking point were reduced. On the other hand, the mean free surface setup inside the surf zone increased. It was also observed that the gravel slope had a stronger influence on the vertical profile of undertow under spilling breaker than on that under a plunging breaker. Moreover, the undertow became weaker over a gravel slope with a larger gravel size. Outside the surf zone, turbulent velocities near the gravel slope were relatively high because of the bottom roughness and percolation. Inside the surf zone, turbulence generated by wave breaking dominated over the gravel bed generated turbulence. The vertical flow induced by the gravel slope changed the turbulence pattern only at cross sections very close to the shoreline. Numerical simulations of the wave breaking processes over a gravel slope were performed. The numerical model was tested by comparing numerical results with experimental data. The model accurately simulated the mean flow quantities. The magnitude of turbulence and turbulence characteristics were also simulated reasonably well.},

Releasing a volume of fresh water into a stratified ambient fluid, three different breaking mechanisms are produced: plunging, collapsing and surging breakers. The different shoaling dynamics affect the ISW evolution over the sloping boundary, inducing different effects on the bottom. In order to investigate the effects of the ISW breaking on the inclined surface, we calculate the bed shear stress and estimate the local flux of sediments entrained from the bed. We analyze the relationship between the breaking criteria and the related effects on the sloping surface. Although plunging breakers are expected to induce significant effects within the fluid, causing larger amount of mixing and fluid entrainment, the effects on the bottom are totally opposite. The collapsing breaker mechanism, indeed, generates boundary layer separation, which in turn induces whirling instabilities. Results show that the ISW interaction with the inclined surface occurs in its close proximity for collapsing breaker mechanism, which explains why the largest bed shear stresses and sediment re-suspension are predicted in the simulation where a collapsing breaker mechanism is observed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Quantitative evidence of sudden shifts in ecological structure and function in large shallow lakes is rare, even though they provide essential benefits to society. Such ?regime shifts? can be driven by human activities which degrade ecological stability including water level control (WLC) and nutrient loading. Interactions between WLC and nutrient loading on the long-term dynamics of shallow lake ecosystems are, however, often overlooked and largely underestimated, which has hampered the effectiveness of lake management. Here, we focus on a large shallow lake (Lake Chaohu) located in one of the most densely populated areas in China, the lower Yangtze River floodplain, which has undergone both WLC and increasing nutrient loading over the last several decades. We applied a novel methodology that combines consistent evidence from both paleolimnological records and ecosystem modeling to overcome the hurdle of data insufficiency and to unravel the drivers and underlying mechanisms in ecosystem dynamics. We identified the occurrence of two regime shifts: one in 1963, characterized by the abrupt disappearance of submerged vegetation, and another around 1980, with strong algal blooms being observed thereafter. Using model scenarios, we further disentangled the roles of WLC and nutrient loading, showing that the 1963 shift was predominantly triggered by WLC, whereas the shift ca. 1980 was attributed to aggravated nutrient loading. Our analysis also shows interactions between these two stressors. Compared to the dynamics driven by nutrient loading alone, WLC reduced the critical P loading and resulted in earlier disappearance of submerged vegetation and emergence of algal blooms by approximately 26 and 10 years, respectively. Overall, our study reveals the significant role of hydrological regulation in driving shallow lake ecosystem dynamics, and it highlights the urgency of using multi-objective management criteria that includes ecological sustainability perspectives when implementing hydrological regulation for aquatic ecosystems around the globe.},

	abstract = {Confluence environments are sites in the drainage network that present a complex flow structure, with specific sediment transport and bed morphology characteristics. In this context, the general objective is to characterize the confluence environment between Paraná and Piquiri rivers, considering the flow structure, bed morphology and sediment concentration. The materials and procedures included: (i) doing fieldwork for suspended and bottom load and its treatment in the laboratory, (ii) using equipment such as the Acustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) to estimate parameters such as discharge, temperature, flow direction, iii) the Ecosonde for the bathymetric survey and mapping of the bed from ordinary kriging, (iv) elaboration of the regression model to estimate the concentration of suspended sediments from the correlation of the ADCP signal return with the material collected in both rivers. The results concerning the bed morphology at the confluence show the position of the Paraná River thalweg on the left bank and the Piquiri River in the channel center. The bed discordance at the confluence indicates that the Piquiri River is deeper than the Paraná River. The confluence morphology indicates the presence of the sediment accumulation zone and the lateral bar on the Paraná River left bank. About the flow structure, it is dominated by the Paraná River. The behavior of the secondary flow and of the helical movements are distinct in the two channels. In the Paraná River, they are influenced by the curvature upstream of the confluence, set of islands, bed discordance and the interaction of the flow with the Piquiri River. In the Piquiri River is influenced by the upstream curvature and bed depth variation. We also identified the flow stagnation zone, flow deflation zone, maximum speed zone and shear layer. The channels showed a difference of 2ºC of the temperature in the confluence environment, evidencing the mixing interface of the flows. Two regression models were used to estimate the suspended sediments, one for each channel. The Piquiri River presents a higher concentration of suspended load. The granulometry of the Paraná River bed load presents fractions of coarser sediments in relation to its tributary. The granulometric distribution for both channels varies according to the areas of greatest and lowest flow velocity. The results achieved were important for understanding this environment. However, the studies should be continued taking into consideration elements such as: performance of the set of islands in the structure and dynamics of the area flow, realization of accurate bathymetric mesh to enhance the features of the bed, and increase the number of collection points of suspended and bottom sediments.},

	abstract = {For the analysis of loads and motions of marine structures in harsh seaways precise information about the hydrodynamics of waves is required. While the surface motion of waves can easily be measured in physical wave tanks other critical characteristics such as the instantaneous particle velocity and acceleration as well as the pressure field, especially under the wave crest are difficult and time-consuming to obtain. Therefore a new method is presented to approximate the wave potential of a given instantaneous wave contour. Numerical methods — so called numerical wave tanks (NWTs) — are developed to provide the desired insight into wave hydrodynamics. A potential theory method based on the Finite Element method (Pot/FE), a RANSE (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations) method applying VOF (Volume of Fluid) and a combination of both is utilized for the simulation of different model wave trains. The coupling of both CFD (computational fluid dynamics) solvers is a useful approach to benefit from the advantages of the two different methods: The Pot/FE solver WAVETUB (wave simulation code developed at Technical University Berlin) allows a very fast and accurate simulation of the propagation of nonbreaking waves while the RANSE/VOF solver has the capability of simulating breaking waves. Two different breaking criteria for the detection of wave breaking are implemented in WAVETUB for triggering the automated coupling process by data transfer at the interface. It is shown that an efficient method for the simulation of breaking wave trains including wave-structure interaction in 2D and 3D is established by the coupling of both CFD codes. All results are discussed in detail.},

Such family of methods is able to generates the microtopography of the object under study and also the stress-strain distribution under a specific loading condition. Moiré means wave like pattern generated when screens of same mesh density are superposed. It is reported the application of a moiré technique in magnifying displacements, being also suitable as a photoelastic method. Three specimens of different wood species were submitted to axial loads before failure meanwhile a grid of specific mesh density was projected onto the object. The experimental setup this work included a digital camera to capture the moiré patterns generated by the projection of a regular grid onto the object and processed by involving software named Gimp and Idrisi.

	abstract = {Geosynthetics or geotextile is used for aggregate separation, soil reinforcement, filtration, drainage and moisture or liquid barriers in geotechnical applications. Because of the environmental issues, a bio-based material is introduced as a sustainable construction material. The kenaf fibre is a bio-based material available in the tropical countries. It can be potentially used as a geotextile because of its high tensile strength. This paper presents the tensile strength characteristics of kenaf geotextile, manufactured with and without sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatment. The tensile strength of kenaf geotextile was determined by using the wide-width strip test based on the ASTM D4595-17 standard. Because the kenaf fibre has a high water absorption capability, the effect of wet and dry conditions on tensile behaviour of kenaf textile was studied. Two patterns of woven kenaf with two different opening sizes between their yarns (0 × 0 and 2 × 2 mm)—plain and incline patterns were studied. In addition, the tensile strength of the kenaf geotextiles, buried in natural ground, was examined after a one-year period. The tensile strength of kenaf geotextiles was higher for the smaller spaces between the yarns. Furthermore, the tensile strength and elongation were lower under wet condition. The alkaline treatment (6\% concentration of NaOH) significantly improved the tensile strength of the woven kenaf geotextile. The tensile strength of the treated kenaf geotextile was higher than that of the untreated one, for both short and long-term conditions, showing the advantage of NaOH treatment.},

	abstract = {Environmental awareness and an increasing concern with sustainable development have stimulated many industries including ground engineering to replace the conventional synthetic fibers. In this work, four natural fibers, namely water hyacinth, reed, sisal, and roselle, were chosen for studies. Initially, the composition, morphology and properties of the four fibers were examined in order to select an appropriate fiber for manufacture of woven limited life geotextiles (LLGs). It was found that total cellulose content of sisal and roselle was higher than that of water hyacinth and reed, in contrast to hemicelluloses content. The highest lignin content was found in reed whereas water hyacinth possessed the highest ash content. Morphology and fiber length of the fibers were determined using optical microscope. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between tensile strength and fiber length; the longer fiber length, the higher tensile strength. Tensile strength of dry sisal, roselle was significantly higher than that of reed and water hyacinth, while elongation of all studied fibers with exception of water hyacinth was not significantly different. Moreover, it is interesting to note that when the fibers are wet, their tensile strength and elongation increase. Their moisture absorption and thermal property were also investigated. Finally, durability of the fibers was assessed in terms of mechanical properties after exposed under an accelerated weathering. From all obtained results, it can be concluded that sisal and roselle showed potential as raw materials for woven LLGs for soil reinforcement while the woven LLGs made of reed and water hyacinth would be suitable for soil erosion control.},

The Sample of compost was prepared by mixing fertile garden soil, cow dung manure and sand in the proportion of 2:1:1.

It was found that jute geotextile treated with bitumen emulsion at the rate of 0.6 kg/m2 and 0.5 kg/m2 revealed 14.49\% and 17.03\% reduction in strength, respectively, as compared to non-biodegradable samples. Along with this, bitumen emulsion treated (BET) jute geotextile treated with the application rate of 0.6 kg/m2 was selected for further research work. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis was also carried, and it was found that there was an improvement in the internal structure of BET jute geotextile as compared to non-treated one. BET jute geotextile in two layers reduced Brittleness Index (IB) considerably. This methodology can be used in the severe earthquake zone for reducing the possibility of enormous damage.},

	abstract = {A process for transesterifying jute fibers or textiles using reagents largely derived from natural sources has been developed for enhancing the long-term tensile strength and water repellence of fiber or textile samples. Geotextiles woven from treated jute fibers (JG1) and geotextiles treated at the fabric level (JG2) using the process developed in this study were found to retain 50\% of their initial tensile strengths after remaining immersed in aqueous solutions with pH between 4 and 9 for 120 days. Correspondingly untreated jute geotextiles (JGU) retained only 15\% of its initial tensile strength. Upon being immersed in 3\% NaCl solution for 120 days, JG1 retained 82\% of its initial tensile strength, while JG2 and JGU retained 64\% and 17\%, respectively. JG1 samples are estimated to loose 50\% of their initial tensile strength after 1115 and 1584 days, respectively, because of UV and moisture related weathering and biodegradation in tropical outdoor environments. The corresponding estimates for JG2 were 881 and 1080 days, respectively. These estimates were about 3–5 times higher than those for JGU. Additionally, degradation of treated fiber or fabric did not produce toxic or hazardous leachate. These enhancements may make jute geotextiles useful in earthworks requiring temporary reinforcement before insitu processes, e.g., vegetation growth, filter cake formation, and development of weak cementation due to biogenic and other processes strengthen the soil obviating further need for reinforcements.},

	abstract = {Biodegradable jute geotextiles are an effective reinforcing material for unpaved roads, but its serviceability is limited because of faster microbial degradation. Different methods are in use to improve the serviceability of jute geotextiles. In this paper, influence of chemical treatment (transesterification and bitumen coating), road design and rainfall intensity on the time dependent serviceability of jute geotextiles has been studied. Chemically treated jute geotextiles, were laid in unpaved road designs with and without sand layer, for 30, 60 and 90 days’ duration, and subjected to simulated rainfall intensities of 50 and 100 mm/h. With increase in time of usage, tensile strength and puncture resistance decrease due to microbial attack, and pore size decreases due to clogging of soil in jute geotextiles. Chemical treatment was observed to have greater influence on the serviceability, followed by the presence of sand layer in road design and the rainfall intensity. Further, overall performance of bitumen coated jute geotextiles was observed to be better than transesterified jute geotextile, due to its hydrophobic nature.},

Three ways of accelerating the kinetics are considered: increased temperature, increased oxygen pressure and the immersion of samples in aqueous media. The quality of the simulated ageing test obtained is discussed by comparing the effectiveness of the stabilizers under accelerated ageing with that anticipated from natural ageing. The paper concludes that high temperature ageing tests (about 130°C) are less representative than tests at more moderate temperatures (80°C) in which ageing is accelerated by high oxygen pressure and immersion in an aqueous medium. This research highlights how difficult it is to develop a representative predictive test given the lack of long-term site data and the strong links which exist between the extent to which tests are representative, the nature of accelerated ageing and the formulations under study.},

The geotextiles were tested for tensile strength, biodegradability, and enhancement of soil fertility. The tensile strength of the geotextiles was found to decrease with addition of stronger nettle fibers. This apparently surprising behavior was explained in the light of theoretical tensile mechanics of nonwovens. Further, the nettle fibers displayed higher biodegradability than the poly(lactic acid) fibers, and when buried under soil, all the geotextiles exhibited a loss in tensile strength. Interestingly, the fertility of the soil was remarkably improved after biodegradation of poly(lactic acid) fibers. Overall, the nonwoven geotextiles prepared in this work were found to be promising for slope stabilization application.},

Os comportamentos coletivos das colônias são realizados através da interação entre os indivíduos de diferentes castas. Embora os soldados exerçam papel de defesa, os indivíduos desta casta são dependentes dos operários para sua alimentação, impondo assim custos para a colônia. Apesar disso, nos grupos de cupins mais derivados (ex. gênero Nasutitermes) ocorre uma elevada proporção de soldados. Nesse estudo, investigamos se os soldados de Nasutitermes corniger são capazes de otimizar o forrageio, testando as hipóteses de que: i) a presença de soldados altera o comportamento do grupo de cupins promovendo maior intensidade de busca e consequentemente uso de mais fontes alimentares simultaneamente; e ii) soldados com informação sobre fontes alimentares são mais eficientes no recrutamento de indivíduos do que operários previamente informados. Bioensaios foram realizados através de filmagens a fim de avaliar se grupos contendo soldados apresentam maior taxa de caminhamento do que grupos sem soldados. Para analisar se grupos com soldados realizam maior busca exploratória, foram feitas arenas com acesso a quatro fontes alimentares, nas quais foram liberados grupos com e sem soldados. As opções de fontes alimentares foram analisadas temporalmente a fim de quantificar suas ocupações. Também foi avaliada a capacidade com que operários e soldados com informação prévia sobre a disponibilidade de recursos conseguem recrutar indivíduos para fontes alimentares. Os dados foram analisados utilizando-se análise de variância e regressão linear, no software R. Nossos resultados mostraram que os soldados não interferem no comportamento de caminhamento, porém, grupos contendo soldados apresentam mais rápida avaliação das fontes disponíveis durante o forrageio do que grupos contendo apenas operários. Soldados e operários previamente informados não diferiram em relação à capacidade de informar e recrutar novos indivíduos para fontes alimentares. Concluímos que os soldados de N. corniger têm um papel importante na fase de exploração do forrageio, permitindo uma rápida avaliação do habitat, assim como realizam o recrutamento semelhante ao observado para os operários.},

	abstract = {Maintenance and renewal costs of a typical railway, track and substructure represents 50-60\% of the total costs of such infrastructure over its entire service life. Innovations in track and substructure are therefore fundamental to achieve a significant impact on the overall cost reduction for the railways. Therefore new solutions for track improvements that are effective and that can minimize the interruption of traffic are needed. Moreover, failures of railway embankments happened recently in different regions of the world. Such events, such as the one happened in UK in February 2013 (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-21441070), are showing the importance of monitoring track and infrastructure coupled with the use of numerical models for the localization of the critical areas and the design of appropriate countermeasures. Indeed embankment failures, landslides and uneven settlements and similar events are becoming much more common than in the past due to climate changes, and this requires the infrastructure managers to look from a different perspective infrastructure maintenance issues. What was previously consider as "extreme" is now "common" and thus actions need to be taken to be ready when such events will happen. The aim is to mitigate their effects on the infrastructure and to minimize disruptions to train services and reduce maintenance costs to restore the normal service conditions. If this mental change happens, then the need for solutions and techniques for global asset monitoring and ground stabilization will probably increase. Among the others, geotextiles and geogrids for soil reinforcement used in combination with condition monitoring techniques have the potential for minimizing catastrophic events, whilst at the same time providing a good balance among costs and benefits (i.e. sustainability). The paper describe a case study where the use of multifunctional geotextiles, able to provide both strengthening and monitoring functions, has been tested along a railroad near the city of Chemnitz (Germany). The results are here reported to show the potential use and the innovative aspect of this solution.},

	abstract = {The Lower São Francisco River has suffered with impacts by changes in river flow caused by public policies implemented in recent decades that prioritized the construction of Electrical Power Dams. Then is very important to search for solutions through techniques to monitor the progress of erosion, especially erosion on rivebanks. From this perspective, we need to build sustainable techniques that can mitigate the soil loss controlling erosion with soil bioengineering techniques and considering the geomorphological dynamics of that environment. The objective of this work was to evaluate the dynamics of erosion on the banks of the São Francisco River in its lower course, and how to mitigate them through the use of geotextiles made from natural fibers for hydro-recovery. Thus, the methodology followed the steps: initially was based on a literature review, then field work for the area recognition and the analysis of the landscape as well as fibers identification in order to develop erosion control techniques, followed by experimental tests and monitoring geotextile evaluated in field and laboratory and then was build a synthesis of the results achieved with the research. The methodological theoretical model used in the research was the GTP (Geosystem, Territory, Landscape) proposed by Bertrand (1971), through a systemic and integrated approach to landscape analysis and the relationship between society and nature in the geographical space. The river banks erosion was registered as a result of fluvial dynamics presented by the São Francisco River, considering the regulated flow from the implementation of Sobradinho and Xingó electrical power dams in the Lower São Francisco (BSF) and associated deforestation, river margins illegal occupation, among other impacts. As a result the research states the presence of erosion on the right bank of the the lower river causing soil loss that is associated with the fluvial dynamics of the river with regulated flow, as well as the conditions of climate and soil of studied area also influence riverbank erosion. From the field experiment it was observed that among the selected fibers to perform the tests for the production of geotextiles, those of Ouricuri and Junco were more efficient in erosion control, but for strength and durability to climatic variables the fiber from Taboa, was the most resistant. In conclusion the use of natural fibers in geotextiles and its application in the riverbanks became an alternative to compose erosion control techniques, based on the results obtained through field and laboratory tests. Finally this research provides to the scientific community a contribution on the erosion on the riverbank, providing useful information for the society as an important technique to erosion control in the riverbanks.},

            The exposure to solar radiation (mainly due to the action of ultraviolet radiation) is one of the main causes for the premature failure of many polymeric materials, including the geotextiles. In this work, a nonwoven polypropylene geotextile (stabilized with a known amount of a hindered amine light stabilizer) was exposed to ultraviolet-aging tests, both in the laboratory (accelerated conditions) and outdoors (natural conditions). The damage occurred in the geotextile (caused by the ultraviolet-aging tests) was evaluated quantitatively (by monitoring changes in its mass per unit area, thickness, and tensile properties) and qualitatively (by scanning electron microscopy). The results, among other findings, showed that: (1) the ultraviolet-aging tests (both in the laboratory and outdoors) induced relevant damage in the polypropylene fibers of the geotextile (transverse cracks), leading to the deterioration of its tensile behavior, (2) the amount of degradation increased with the increase of the ultraviolet radiant energy, (3) the laboratory tests caused a faster deterioration of the polypropylene fibers than the outdoor tests, and (4) the degradation found by scanning electron microscopy in the polypropylene fibers correlated well with the deterioration occurred in the tensile behavior of the geotextile.},

For the production of the geotextiles, the strips of woollen nonwoven were used. The segments of the geotextiles were installed on the bank of a drainage ditch. The behaviour of the geotextiles during 1 year was observed. It was demonstrated that the geotextiles installed in the ditch provide immediate protection of the bank. In the soil-covered wool, the process of slow biodegradation was initiated. Because of a low biodegradation rate at the end of the growing season, when the protective vegetation was not well developed, the geotextiles maintained their protective potential. In the following months, the biodegradation led to further destruction of wool fibres. During the biodegradation, the organic compounds rich in nitrogen were released into the soil. In spring, at the beginning of new growing season, the compounds acted as effective fertilizers, promoting the growth of protective vegetation. The vegetation growing on the bank provided an effective protection and took over the protective function of the geotextiles.},

The methodological procedures taken in the research accomplishment were: Survey and analysis of bibliographical and cartographic data; handmade confection of 40 geotextile (buriti mat); preparation of two plots measuring 10 m2 each and having 12º of declivity; application of seeds and fertilizers in the area, such as NPK, calcareous and vegetal cover; pluviometric index monitoring; photo comparison; tensiometry (120, 80, 30 and 15 cm in depth) and measurement of soil superficial humidity. The weight of sediments collected (2l) in the gallons, granulometry, amount of organic substance and pH was analyzed in the laboratory. There were two plots at the experimental station, bare ground and geotextile. They were monitored for 6 months and the collected data was always noted and compared. In the geotextile plot, superficial humidity was maintained, which was essential for seeds germination and proven in the experiment from the data of superficial humidity that had varied in the bare ground between 1,1 26.9\%, while in the geotextile it had been between 3,5 34.1\%.
The highest superficial humidity index on the geotextile experiment was practically constant, since its application up to the vegetal covering development. The tensiometry data demonstrated the vegetation radicular system importance in the distribution and maintenance of water in the ground, the smallest pore pressure was detected in the depths of 15 and 30 cm in the geotextile plot, reaching-67,1 kPa. In the bare ground, the pore pressure was constant, not exceeding -27,7 kPa (15 cm), which demonstrated a more saturated ground, with rapid superficial flow formation. It had been registered 1,087 mm of rain during the monitoring process, causing a superficial draining of 2,991, 6 l in the bare ground, while in the system SG superficial flow came to 1,289, 2 l. In regards to the erosive process, the results pointed a significant difference in the containment of sediments in the plot having geotextile and grass reaching 13,18kg/10m2, while in the bared SOIL it came to 197,26Kg/10m2.},

The coefficients are converted using Fisher's z-transformation with standard errors (N − 3)−1/2. The two transformed values are then compared using a standard normal procedure. When data are not bivariate normal, Spearman's correlation coefficient rho is often used as the index of correlation. Comparison of two Spearman rhos is not as well documented. Three approaches were investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. Treating the Spearman coefficients as though they were Pearson coefficients and using the standard Fisher's z-transformation and subsequent comparison was more robust with respect to Type I error than either ignoring the nonnormality and computing Pearson coefficients or converting the Spearman coefficients to Pearson equivalents prior to transformation.},

While most entrepreneurial entry studies rarely consider an industry choice to be an aspect of entrepreneurial decision making process, we address this issue taking into account individual, industrial, and country specific attributes. Using data from the Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students’ Survey (2013–2014) on young nascent entrepreneurs and extending it with objective indicators derived from World Bank, Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, and International Property Rights Index datasets, we investigate how various factors impact the choice between knowledge-intensive and capital-intensive industries. Drawing on the RBV and contingency approach, we link an industry choice to the level of human capital development and access to financial capital testing for possible country-specific moderation effects. Our study contributes to entrepreneurial entry research stream extending the understanding of entrepreneurial entry decision making nuances related to individual access to resources and both industryand country-level contingencies.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of materials used for developing engineering structures should be properly foreseen during the design phase. Regarding geosynthetics, which are construction materials used in a wide range of engineering structures, the installation on site and the action of many degradation agents during service life may promote changes in their properties, endangering the structures in which they are applied. The evaluation of the damage suffered by geosynthetics, like installation damage or abrasion, is often carried out through laboratory tests. This work studied the behaviour of five geosynthetics (three geotextiles and two geogrids) after being individually and successively exposed to two degradation tests: mechanical damage under repeated loading and abrasion. The short-term mechanical and hydraulic behaviours of the geosynthetics were analysed by performing tensile tests and water permeability normal to the plane tests. Reduction factors were determined based on the changes occurred in the tensile strength of the geosynthetics. Findings showed that mechanical damage under repeated loading and abrasion tended to affect the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the geosynthetics and that the reduction factors calculated according to the traditional method may not be able to represent accurately the damage suffered by the materials when exposed successively to the degradation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The article proposes to construct and analyze the research landscape on the sustainability performance evaluation of agricultural cooperatives’ operations. The research was characterized as a systematic review of the literature, carried out through the ProKnow-C structured process, complemented by a procedure known as Snowball to form the portfolio of articles, theses and dissertations to be studied. The research results highlight models for the evaluation of the sustainability of agricultural cooperatives’ operations that are still under construction. There are few studies that explain what a performance evaluation is, and there are no authors who have stood out in the research on this theme. Most sustainability assessment models for cooperatives do not address the three dimensions of sustainability in an integrated way, and the uniqueness of the decision maker is not proposed, since there is a predominance of Normativistic and Descriptive approaches. Mapping and organizing the body of knowledge on the theme of sustainability in agricultural cooperatives in the topic of performance evaluation is the main contribution of the article, since many previous studies did not address this. To that end, a conceptual map that outlines the thematic categories of sustainability performance evaluation of agricultural cooperatives’ operations was constructed, identifying where future research is needed, both for the construction of new theories and models and for the execution of empirical studies.},

Nesse sentido, o papel que a universidade desempenha é complexo, e deve visar o acompanhamento do dinamismo da contemporaneidade. Assumir esse papel de formação de indivíduos com perfis diferenciados necessita da quebra da postura de ensino tradicional, e a busca por novas formas de ensinar e de aprender. A educação transformadora propicia ambientes de ensino e de aprendizagem favoráveis à formação desses novos sujeitos, que sejam empreendedores e protagonistas em relação a sua aprendizagem, de forma que saibam lidar com as demandas impostas pelo mercado de trabalho, pelo seu contexto social e pela sua própria vida. A Pedagogia Empreendedora, associada às Metodologias Ativas, surgem com um primeiro passo potencializador para a mudança do sistema de ensino. Com o objetivo de atender a esse novo fazer pedagógico e a melhoria do ensino, este estudo traz para reflexão a percepção de acadêmicos em relação ao desenvolvimento da pedagogia empreendedora nas aulas de graduação. De modo geral, percebeu-se que os métodos ativos de ensino propostos por esta metodologia favoreceram o ambiente de aprendizagem, à medida que permitiu que os estudantes se tornassem mais ativos, criativos e empreendedores. Os resultados apontaram que, na percepção dos sujeitos participantes desta pesquisa, a pedagogia empreendedora e as metodologias ativas promoveram evolução no aprendizado e crescimento pessoal.},

This paper delves into such matters insofar as it brings to bear a qualitative research associated with a quantitative one, both targeted to identify the motives underlying the genesis of new undertakings. While the first procedure suggests the presence of multiple motives, the second - built from generated references - ratifies the occurrence of such motives. Results suggest that underlying motives bypass the binary conundrum of need versus opportunity and go deeper, in order to include: opportunity, personal attributes, labor markets, job frustration, family pressures, and external influences.},

Ao fazê-lo, o país tem ressaltado que a propriedade intelectual não é tema associado exclusivamente ao comércio, mas também à saúde pública e aos direitos humanos. Sendo assim, o presente estudo propõe-se a analisar a atuação do governo brasileiro no âmbito de negociações multilaterais que envolvem saúde pública, inovação e propriedade intelectual. Ao resgatar a memória da atuação da diplomacia brasileira nessa área específica, conclui-se que o Brasil vem protagonizando esse debate, buscando alternativas que mitiguem os efeitos deletérios do atual sistema internacional de propriedade intelectual no acesso a medicamentos e outras tecnologias médicas nos países em desenvolvimento.},

In this context, the authors of this paper present a quantitative analysis of the scientific production about Innovation and IP, between 2000 and 2010, tracing a panorama of the state of the art at the intersection of the two fields. Two samples were extracted from ISI and Scopus databases, containing respectively 3,142 and 2,876 published titles, at the intersection of these themes. Featured articles are cited in the samples, in addition to the journals and authors more productive and more referenced. We believe this study contributes to better understand the knowledge published about Innovation and IP, serving as inspiration for researchers seeking to develop new studies, and helping them to create a good strategy for their literature review.},

					Este artigo tem como objetivo analisar os níveis de intenção empreendedora dos alunos do curso de Administração da Universidade Federal do Ceará. Para tanto, foi aplicado um questionário elaborado com base no modelo apresentado pelo GUESSS para identificação do nível de intenção empreendedora nos estudantes universitários, que utiliza os princípios da Teoria do Comportamento Planejado (TCP) como pilares para a sua caracterização. A etodologia da pesquisa, portanto, deu-se mediante abordagem quantitativa, com coleta de dados primários em uma plataforma online, no formato survey. Com a análise dos resultados, foi possível destacar que os alunos de Administração da Universidade Federal do Ceará possuem uma baixa intenção de empreender em algum momento da vida. Apesar disso, os discentes indicam que a universidade pode melhorar em vários aspectos do ensino para promover o empreendedorismo universitário.},

Em um contexto de aceleração tecnológica e aprofundamento da crise do capital, criaram-se novas formas de apropriação capitalista do conhecimento produzido pelas universidades públicas brasileiras, em todas as suas atividades. Este artigo busca contribuir para a caracterização do novo neoliberalismo acadêmico a partir da análise da articulação entre as políticas de ampliação do acesso e de incentivo à inovação nas universidades públicas brasileiras. O Novo Neoliberalismo acadêmico é um conceito que descreve a exacerbação das características historicamente registradas na mercantilização capitalista no ensino superior. No Brasil, as políticas neoliberais para o ensino superior foram se transformando, adquirindo novas características em função das mudanças nas recomendações dos organismos internacionais. Caracterizamos, assim, o novo neoliberalismo acadêmico como um conjunto de políticas e programas que criam políticas ditas inclusivas; flexibilizam a formação por meio da oferta de novas modalidades de cursos; modificam o financiamento; estabelecem o empreendedorismo como cultura a ser disseminada pela universidade; difundem o gerencialismo; e precarizam as relações de trabalho nas universidades públicas.},

Para tanto, foram utilizadas as bibliotecas TerraLib e SOMCode, ambas de código aberto e escritas na linguagem C++, desenvolvidas pelo Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) e pela Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros (CPATC), respectivamente. Os dados utilizados para a geração desses mapas foram obtidos por uma grade de sensores de uma unidade piloto da plataforma Irrigap, desenvolvida pela Embrapa Instrumentação Agropecuária (CNPDIA), dados esses referentes a medidas horárias de umidade e temperatura do solo e temperatura do ar. Diferentes métodos de interpolação foram utilizados, com o intuito de verificar qual a melhor maneira de se gerar mapas que possibilitem a visualização de áreas com o mesmo comportamento com relação às variáveis de solo e climatológicas, as chamadas zonas de manejo agrícolas. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que é possível a identificação dessas zonas, desde que sejam utilizados os algoritmos corretos para cada situação. Além disso, aplicativos para a geração de mapas temáticos utilizando dados reais podem se tornar importantes para a tomada de decisão em agricultura de precisão, proporcionando benefícios como a economia de água e energia durante o período de irrigação.},

Durante os últimos 30 anos, a produção de grãos no Brasil cresceu a uma taxa de 4,6\% ao ano, enquanto a área plantada cresceu apenas 1,7\% ao ano. Essa diferença é explicada pelo aumento da produtividade, e esse aumento, em grande parte, pode ser explicado pela adoção do uso racional de fertilizantes. Baseados essencialmente em inovação tecnológica, esses aumentos de produtividade agrícola no Brasil constatam a necessidade de um fluxo contínuo de conhecimentos técnicos para a sustentabilidade do setor. Em um ambiente no qual o uso adequado de fertilizantes pode promover, simultaneamente, aumento de produtividade agrícola e proteção e preservação da flora e fauna nativas, muitos produtores ainda realizam a correção do solo e adubação de suas lavouras sem observar qualquer critério racional de uso, utilizando formulações de nutrientes e quantidades fixas, prática que pode, ao longo do tempo, favorecer o desbalanço no fornecimento desses nutrientes, uma vez que essas adubações podem estar sendo realizadas de forma sub ou superdimensionadas. As ferramentas de agricultura de precisão podem auxiliar na obtenção dessas informações.},

This report presents a broad measure of social entrepreneurship activity as well as a narrow measure. The broad measure considers individuals who are starting or currently leading any kind of activity, organization or initiative that has a particularly social, environmental or community objective. The narrow measure imposes the following restrictions: that this activity, organization or initiative (i) prioritizes social and environmental value over financial value; and (ii) operates in the market by producing goods and services. The narrow definition is available for 31 economies.   The main findings from this report include:},

Objetivos: Identificar e analisar os padrões alimentares entre os adolescentes brasileiros. Métodos: Foram utilizados dados da Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde do Escolar de 2015 (n = 10.926 adolescentes). A identificação e a análise dos padrões alimentares foram realizadas por meio da análise de componentes principais e pela regressão linear, respectivamente. Resultados: Dois padrões foram identificados: o primeiro, caracterizado por marcadores de uma alimentação não saudável; e o segundo, por marcadores de uma alimentação saudável. A adesão ao padrão não saudável esteve positivamente associada aos adolescentes do sexo feminino, que possuem mães com, ao menos, ensino fundamental completo, que residem em regiões mais desenvolvidas e em área urbana, bem como entre aqueles que possuem o hábito de não tomar café da manhã, não realizar as refeições com os pais/responsáveis, se alimentar enquanto estuda ou assiste TV e frequentar restaurantes fast-food. Discussão: Análises do consumo de grupos alimentares isolados, que não consideram a dieta em toda a sua complexidade, têm se mostrado insuficientes na explicação dos principais desfechos da área de nutrição em saúde pública. Conclusão: Os achados contribuíram para a identificação de grupos populacionais mais vulneráveis ao padrão alimentar não saudável e para a compreensão da coexistência de diferentes determinantes ao hábito alimentar entre os adolescentes.},

The methodology used was a qualitative, exploratory and descriptive approach. The data collection procedure was done through the application of semi-structured interviews resulting in 19 case studies, the criterion for choosing the participants was the distribution and performance in the mesoregions of the State and, to analyze the data of the research, the technique of content analysis. It is concluded in this research that Paraná occupies the third place with 25 Agtechs, 12\% in the national panorama. The North Central and Southwest regions, concentrate 63\% of the State. It can be affirmed that the Paraná ecosystem is in a learning and maturing phase, where resistance and institutionalism between the actors is evident, causing slowness and lack of focus on practical results. The main resources are training or consulting, specialists researchers, but lack mentoring with experience in the agro to meet in a personalized way the needs of Agtechs. It is suggested as a future study some developments, such as: (i) to measure the relations of articulation and the results generated in the promotion of new business for all the actors of the ecosystem; (ii) to evaluate Agtechs' articulation model in other locations in Brazil and to compare it with the results of the Paraná ecosystem; (iii) investigate the business environment of more developed ecosystems like Israel and the United States to find the competitive differentials of these countries; and (iv) analyze the financial feasibility of investment for the development of regional innovation centers focused on the development of applied research and business creation.},

Para tanto, utilizou-se de uma abordagem qualitativa, descritiva, aliada ao estudo de caso, onde os dados foram coletados mediante pesquisa documental e entrevistas semiestruturadas. Com base na Teoria dos Custos de Transação (TCT), os custos agrícolas da produção rural de arroz foram abordados. A área rural estudada utiliza 205 hectares arrendados para o plantio, sendo o cultivo pré-germinado empregado em 87\% da área, enquanto o plantio direto é utilizado no restante. As variáveis “custo, volume e lucro” foram analisadas para identificar os resultados por tipo de plantio, tendo sido adotado, para apuração dos custos, o método de Custeio Direto. Os resultados indicam que a produção no cultivo pré-germinado apresenta menor custo de produção, maior produtividade e maior lucro em relação aos volumes produzidos por hectare, comparando com os resultados do plantio direto. Espera-se que esses resultados contribuam com os empresários rurais, agricultores e profissionais de contabilidade no processo decisório quanto à apuração dos custos agrícolas.},

O problema de pesquisa apresenta o seguinte questionamento: como a política pública de ATER estabelece relação com o desenvolvimento rural sustentável para agricultura familiar? Para tanto, procurou-se compreender a atuação das políticas públicas de ATER; identificar quais as principais diretrizes da Política Nacional de Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural (PNATER) que contribuem para o desenvolvimento rural sustentável e sugerir ferramentas que auxiliem a ATER na promoção ao processo de desenvolvimento rural sustentável. Com respaldo bibliográfico e documental, com abordagem qualitativa, o artigo realiza uma revisão com viés na atualização da legislação de ATER, vislumbrando perspectivas futuras. Nesta análise, que percorre a trajetória da extensão rural no país, destacam-se os apontamentos que subsidiam as políticas públicas como instrumentos fundamentais para sua execução efetiva. Tal execução prevê a utilização de ferramentais que auxiliem a ATER no fomento ao desenvolvimento da agricultura familiar em três vertentes complementares. Uma vertente sustentável, outra participativa e uma terceira, que se apoia na articulação entre ATER/pesquisa/ensino, tendo como base processo dialógico orientado à comunicação para o meio rural.},

	abstract = {A demanda mundial por alimentos é constante, assim como a busca por novas tecnologias na cultura da soja. A construção do perfil de solo para altas produtividades é primordial, a produtividade é definida pela interação entre planta, ambiente de produção e manejo adequado. A compactação é um processo de degradação física dos solos que interfere no desempenho das lavouras e na produção de grãos. Para obter produtividades mais elevadas, os valores de resistência (RS) devem estar abaixo de 1,70 MPa até a camada de 30 cm e menores que 1,6 e 1,5 MPa na camada entre 40 e 50 cm. A escarificação pode ser uma alternativa, após um diagnóstico confirmando as áreas compactadas. Maiores rendimentos de grãos de soja foram observados após a escarificação biológica do solo isolada ou associada ao uso do escarificador. Solos com boas qualidades físicas propiciam melhor aproveitamento pelas raízes propiciando um melhor desempenho da cultura. Independente do sistema de cultivo, a compactação é um processo inerente, isso ocorre em decorrência de vários motivos, para alcançar altas produtividades são necessários os monitoramentos destes impedimentos físicos, e a aplicação de manejo adequado. O objetivo geral deste trabalho foi identificar a interferência de uma das principais variáveis que podem afetar a produtividade de soja, mediante a um estudo exploratório multidisciplinar através de investigações que se deram por meio de pesquisas bibliográficas avaliando qual a relação que a compactação do solo exerce nas produtividades de soja.},

Assim, o objetivo desse estudo foi diagnosticar e analisar a percepção dos alunos em relação às suas experiências nesta instituição, dentre estas, com a disciplina Gestão Organizacional. O empreendedorismo jovem no sentido amplo, em que exemplos práticos e ferramentas úteis são apresentados e utilizados pelos alunos, apresenta-se como forma de inclusão de jovens no mercado de trabalho e em contrapartida é fator preponderante para promoção do desenvolvimento socioeconômico brasileiro (LIMA-FILHO, SPROESSER e MARTINS, 2009; BULGACOV, 2010). Nesse sentido, esta pesquisa de natureza exploratória e descritiva utilizou um questionário com perguntas abertas e fechadas para a coleta de dados, seguido por uma análise quantitativa e qualitativa. Os questionários foram aplicados junto aos alunos dos cursos técnico integrado em alimentos e informática (nível médio – turmas concluintes do 4º ano) nos anos de 2012, 2013 e 2014 do IFRN – Campus Currais Novos, que cursaram a disciplina Gestão Organizacional, totalizando 215 alunos que compuseram o universo pesquisado. Os resultados indicaram que a experiência na instituição, bem como com a didática utilizada na disciplina, foram positivas.},

	abstract = {As condições e o ambiente de ensino nas escolas brasileiras, a formação e qualificação do professor são problemas que interferem na qualidade da aprendizagem do aluno, desgasta o profissional e preocupa a família que se interessa pelo conhecimento que o filho está adquirindo. A utilização de métodos e práticas de ensino pouco atraentes desmotiva o aluno, inibe seu interesse em construir seu conhecimento. Muitas mudanças foram inseridas no sistema de ensino brasileiro no sentido de atrair e manter o aluno em sala de aula até completar os ciclos escolares. A mudança mais significativa em se tratando da formação do aluno foi a inclusão do ensino profissionalizante, que representa uma oportunidade a mais para a entrada no mercado de trabalho. A partir das exigências do mercado de trabalho, o sistema de ensino brasileiro apresenta uma nova proposta de ensino, ou seja, a Educação Empreendedora cuja principal característica é a capacidade de construção de novos conhecimentos a partir dos conhecimentos precedentes. Assim, o referencial teórico tem seu desenvolvimento fundamentado na pesquisa bibliográfica e descritiva, com abordagem temática sobre empreendedorismo, o trabalho com projetos, currículo e a educação empreendedora. Conclui-se que trabalhar o empreendedorismo no prisma da educação pode ser uma estratégia diferencial para despertar no aluno o interesse pela construção do seu conhecimento.},

Firstly, a historic description of the entrepreneurship education in the universities has been developed as well as its importance in the social economic development of the countries and in the generation of innovations, followed by an explanation of its current situation in the world and in Brazil. In a second stage was outlined the methodology, seeking analyze the main publications on the topic of entrepreneurship education. They were searched in all its contents of the publication, the annals: Enanpad and Egepe; and international periodics: Journal of Business Venturing and Education + Training. They were reviewed, although, publications of the authors of domestic and foreign most authoritative on the subject, as well as other important international journals that address the topic of entrepreneurial training, but not through a general review of publications. The main results show that: the universities are implementing the entrepreneurship education in their curricular grades using more efficient didactic-pedagogical practices, but not putting aside, in most of the times, the traditional methods of education; the professor therefore shall establish a balance between the roles of facilitating and teaching in the process of learning; the professors’ former experience and work in small companies will help the students in the process of learning and undertaking. However, it is important to mention, that the incubators are essential for the implementation of the business plans developed by the students.},

	abstract = {O interesse pela aprendizagem e educação empreendedoras cresceu significativamente na última década, estimulando novas formas de pensar sobre o indivíduo empreendedor e o papel do ensino no seu desenvolvimento. Enquanto a formação universitária tradicional transfere conhecimentos e saberes, a formação empreendedora busca desenvolver o “saber ser”, o “aprender a aprender”, o “saber tornar-se” e o “saber passar à ação”, evocando novas formas de relação e interação dos elementos envolvidos no processo de ensino e aprendizagem. Mais do que criar e realizar uma “educação em empreendedorismo” ou uma “educação para o empreendedorismo”, como se buscou no passado, é preciso desenvolver uma “educação empreendedora”. Com base nessas constatações, este artigo de desenvolvimento teórico tem o intuito de analisar a natureza da aprendizagem e educação empreendedoras, reunindo e confrontando entendimentos sobre as suas características e especificidades a fim de se melhor compreender o ser empreendedor e seu processo de formação.  A compreensão da natureza empreendedora e de como se manifesta o ser empreendedor pode nortear as ações a serem realizadas com o propósito de se criar ambientes e sujeitos empreendedores, partindo-se de uma proposta de educação empreendedora.},

	title = {Educação {Superior} em {Empreendedorismo} e {Intenções} {Empreendedoras} dos {Estudantes} - {Relatório} do {Estudo} {GUESSS} {Brasil} 2013-2014},
	abstract = {O presente relatório traz os resultados do Estudo GUESSS Brasil de 2013-2014 obtidos a partir de dados provenientes de questionários respondidos por 12.561 estudantes de pouco mais de 60 instituições de ensino superior (IES) brasileiras. A coleta dos dados ocorreu de outubro de 2013 a janeiro de 2014. O objetivo aqui perseguido é o de contribuir para o aperfeiçoamento da educação superior brasileira a partir do estudo das intenções de carreira e das condições de formação dos universitários, principalmente no que se refere a ter um negócio próprio, ou seja, atuar como um empreendedor.
Estudantes das mais variadas áreas têm interesse em ter seu próprio negócio (como um consultório dentário, uma empresa de cuidados médicos em domicílio, enfermagem ou fisioterapia, uma firma de serviços de personal trainer, um comércio – mesmo que informal). Tal interesse pode ser colocado em prática em qualquer momento da vida, próximo ou não da formatura dos estudantes.
Em particular para esses estudantes que têm intenção empreendedora, mas também para aqueles que não pensam em empreender, uma educação superior que trabalha bem com o tema do empreendedorismo tem muitos benefícios a oferecer. Ela pode levar aos jovens a melhoraria de sua preparação para a carreira e o aumento do número daqueles que são inovadores, proativos e de iniciativa, o que são qualidades de impacto socioeconômico relevante, queiram eles ser empreendedores ou empregados (Alvarez e Busenitz, 2004; Fayolle, Gailly e Lassas-Clerc, 2006; Guerra e Grazziotin, 2010; Lanero et al., 2011).
GUESSS é a sigla em Inglês para Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students’ Survey, o que podemos traduzir por levantamento mundial sobre o espírito empreendedor de estudantes universitários. No Brasil, a denominação simplificada que adotamos é Estudo GUESSS Brasil, que significa Estudo Mundial sobre Empreendedorismo junto aos Estudantes Universitários do Brasil.
Para a obtenção das 12.561 respostas dos estudantes brasileiros, a coordenação nacional do estudo encaminhou a 80 professores parceiros (responsáveis pela coleta de dados em suas respectivas IES – para ver lista completa: para ver a lista completa: http://guesssbrasil.org/instituicoes-de-ensinoparticipantes/) de instituições distintas um pedido para que convidassem por e-mail os estudantes a responderem o questionário online utilizado. Aproximadamente 220 mil estudantes foram contatados (taxa de resposta de 5,7\%), mas não apenas por e-mail. Em diferentes IES, houve também o uso de páginas de internet, intranet, avisos dados em sala de aula, cartazes e até mesmo de mensagens SMS enviadas por telefone celular. Também de modo semelhante ao que foi feito na edição anterior do estudo, os incentivos de resposta dados aos estudantes do Brasil incluíram: a possibilidade de usarem o momento da resposta como oportunidade de reflexão sobre sua carreira, a provocação para discutirem construtivamente elementos dessa reflexão com professores e colegas e um sorteio de cinco iPads Mini, feito na Suíça pela organização internacional do estudo.
Outra prática da edição brasileira anterior foi reempregada: com vistas a se obter uma elevada taxa de resposta, aos professores foram oferecidos dois exercícios sobre opções de carreira que poderiam fazer com seus alunos (ver os apêndices 1 e 2). Esse material pedagógico ficou à disposição dos professores no portal do estudo: http://guesssbrasil.org/beneficios-para-os-professores.
Sendo um dos maiores estudos feitos atualmente no mundo sobre o tema focado, o GUESSS oferece a oportunidade de se fazer comparativos nacionais e internacionais de IES, interesses de carreira dos estudantes e preparação para empreender feita por eles. Isso favorece a troca de melhores práticas e o benchmarking para os diferentes países e instituições. Também propicia a geração de melhorias para a direção universitária, as práticas de ensino e até mesmo de políticas públicas do campo da educação. Reforça esse potencial de contribuição a dimensão que tomou o GUESSS. Nesta sua última edição, o estudo internacional obteve 109.026 questionários respondidos de estudantes de 759 IES localizadas em 34 países (mais informações: www.guesssurvey.org).},

	abstract = {O Brasil enfrenta inúmeras dificuldades no seu desenvolvimento relacionadas às questões sociais ligadas à fragilidade do processo educacional. O Empreendedorismo, além de cooperar para a promoção do crescimento econômico e da diminuição das desigualdades sociais, também ajuda na melhoria da qualidade de vida da população por meio do aumento da empregabilidade e de uma melhor distribuição de renda. A Educação a Distância (EaD) é uma modalidade formativa tornando-se cada vez mais um instrumento funda­mental na ascensão de oportunidades para muitas pessoas. Assim sendo, acredita-se que ela demonstra ser uma modalidade de ensino que se ajusta às necessidades brasileiras, pois além de minimizar as distâncias, os isolamentos geográficos e as desigualdades sociais, pode também suprir a carência de formação educacional da população do país. O objetivo deste artigo é avaliar como o Capital Humano dos egressos qualificados pela EaD proporciona uma maior capacidade para exercer atividades empreendedoras a partir de uma pesquisa de campo realizada com alunos egressos dos cursos de Pós-Graduação Lato Sensu de uma instituição de ensino superior privada do interior do Estado de São Paulo. Os sujeitos da pesquisa foram 712 alunos egressos dos 190 cursos de Pós-graduação Lato Sensu – Nível de Especialização da instituição de ensino na modalidade à distância, concluintes no período de 2011 até maio de 2016. Os resultados coletados permitiram concluir que a EaD contribui para que o indivíduo, após capacitado por esta modalidade, se torne um profissional participativo na criação de soluções estratégicas para os problemas e necessidades da sociedade.},

	abstract = {Este artigo traz uma reflexão crítica sobre a análise comparativa dos processos de desenvolvimento rural no Brasil, na União Europeia e na China. Argumenta-se que os elementos contextuais e/ou as características do processo, em grande parte ignorados em abordagens do tipo estudo de caso (seja porque são mais ou menos invisíveis e/ou porque são mais ou menos autoevidentes), podem vir à tona através de uma abordagem comparativa. Ao mesmo tempo, a natureza específica dos processos singulares de desenvolvimento rural pode, do mesmo modo, ser explicitada por meio de comparações sistematicamente organizadas. Assim, os atuais processos de desenvolvimento rural são caracterizados como um conjunto de respostas às falhas de mercado - um conjunto de respostas que requer e envolve a construção ativa de novos mercados aninhados.

            This paper contains a critical reflection on a comparative analysis of rural development processes in Brazil, the European Union and China. It argues that those contextual elements and/or process characteristics that are mostly ignored by a case-study approach (for being more or less invisible and/or for being more or less self-evident) might come to the fore through a comparative approach. Simultaneously, the particular nature of single rural development processes might equally be specified through systematically organized comparisons. In this way, current rural development processes are characterized as a set of responses to market failures - a set of responses that requires and involves the active construction of new, nested markets.},

	abstract = {The IEA-R1, swimming pool research reactor, from the Institute of Energy and Nuclear Research (IPEN), among other uses, the instrumental neutron activation analysis technique is widely used, and successfully, by the Neutron Activation Laboratory (LAN), using the comparative method. In this method a sample is irradiated simultaneously with a standard. In order to overcome the difficulty of a multi-elementary analysis, because it was necessary to prepare several standards, the k0 method of neutron activation was developed. In method k, the concentration of sample elements is calculated in relation to a comparator element, generally gold. However, for the use of the k0 method, it is necessary to accurately determine the detection efficiency in the energy range of interest and the geometry of the experimental arrangement. In order to circumvent the manual processing of the data in spreadsheets, which could be affected by errors, a free code web software was developed for calibration in absolute efficiency of an HPGe type detector for neutron activation analysis based on the k0. We used the free, low learning curve standardized Python programming language in the eScience project, which is part of the software, and the Django web framework with a simple and intuitive interface. In the system it is possible to register the detectors, radioactive sources and their manufacturers, projects and spectra, attributes necessary to calculate the absolute efficiency of an HPGe type detector. In addition to calculating efficiency, the system plots the graph with the efficiency points, trend curve, with possibility of adjustments, and error bar representing the uncertainties. The system issues reports on spectra and efficiency data for each project. The reports make it possible to check the data as well as its use in other applications. Because it is a web software, its access is allowed from any device with an internet connection. Another result obtained with the system is the reduction of the possibility of errors with the manual treatment of the data in spreadsheets.},

Porém, parcela significativa da população não tem acesso a uma alimentação adequada que possa caracterizar uma condição de segurança alimentar. Sugere-se que esse cenário decorre, principalmente, de aspectos sociais, entre os quais se destaca a desigual distribuição de renda. Políticas públicas foram implantadas no período analisado de modo a minimizar essa condição, destacando-se o Programa Fome Zero. Contudo, verifica-se que é preciso criar condições de inserção social e econômica para a população por meio do incentivo a novas atividades locais, que contribuam também para o desenvolvimento rural.Código JEL {\textbar} L66; Q18; Q56.},

Este artigo tem por objetivo identificar o grau de importância que os micro e pequenos empresários dão a essas ferramentas gerenciais, especificamente o plano de negócios, para a abertura e gestão de uma empresa. Considera-se que os conhecimentos relacionados com essas ferramentas gerenciais estão atrelados à formação acadêmica do empresário. Constata-se, ao final, a importância das instituições de ensino, principalmente dos cursos de administração, na capacitação dos estudantes para a atividade empreendedora. Além disso, verificou-se que, apesar de considerarem o plano de negócios uma ferramenta essencial para a gestão do empreendimento, ainda é grande a negligência dos empreendedores quanto à prática do planejamento.},

In this period there were intensive changes that have altered the dynamics of income in rural areas, such as the Non-agricultural occupations, an increase in the number of beneficiaries of income transfers, and an increase in retirees by the special rural retirement scheme. Using PNAD data, we sought to investigate socioeconomic factors and those related to productivity, infrastructure and occupation type, in order to shed light on the causes associated with the state of poverty in rural areas. We concluded that the three main changes observed in the rural areas contribute to the reduction of poverty and income inequality in these areas.},

To evaluate the factors affecting the interfacial strength properties of polypropylene fiber (PP-fiber) reinforced soil, single fiber pull-out tests were performed by using a modified special apparatus. It has been found that the designed pull-out test is an efficient method to qualitatively obtain the interfacial peak strength (IPS) and interfacial residual strength (IRS) of fiber/soil. Both the IPS and IRS decrease with water content increase, while increase with increasing soil dry density. The cement inclusions dramatically improve the interfacial shear strength of fiber/soil, and the IPS and IRS increase with an increase in additives content and curing time. Finally, by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the micromechanical interaction behavior between soil particles and fiber reinforcement were discussed. The interfacial shear resistance of fiber/soil depends primarily on the rearrangement resistance of soil particles, effective interface contact area, fiber surface roughness and soil compositions, etc.},

	abstract = {A irrigação localizada tem sua importância dentro da agricultura brasileira principalmente pelo baixo consumo de água, em função da crise hídrica que o pais vem enfrentando nos últimos anos, mas também pelo menor gasto em energia e elevada uniformidade de distribuição de água. Porém um dos problemas enfrentados quando este sistema é colocado subsuperficialmente. O entupimento dos emissores, ocasionado pelas partículas do solo ou intrusão radicular objetivou avaliar diferentes gramaturas de geotêxtil na cobertura dos gotejadores instalados subsuperficalmente como uma lâmina física para impedir ou minimizar o entupimento dos emissores no cultivo de gramas cultivadas. Os gotejadores receberam cobertura com diferentes gramaturas de geotêxtil, como uma barreira física para impedir ou minimizar o grau de entupimento. O experimento foi conduzido em casa de vegetação, no Departamento de Solos e Recursos Ambientais da Faculdade de Ciências Agronômicas, UNESP, município de Botucatu - SP. O delineamento experimental foi em blocos casualizados (DBC), com oito tratamentos: T1 sem geotêxtil, T2 geotêxtil não tecido agulhado em polipropileno (N26.1), T3 geotêxtil não tecido agulhado em polipropileno (N30.1) e T4 geotêxtil não tecido agulhado em polipropileno (N40.1), com cinco repetições, e duas gramíneas, totalizando 40 unidades experimentais em vasos de 25 litros. Observou-se que as espécies de gramas cultivadas não apresentaram resultados significativos, ao analisar as imagens pelo WinRhizo, em número de raízes, comprimento e volume entre espécies e tratamentos aos 30, 60, 90 e 120 (DAP). A massa fresca avaliada das aparas apresentaram resultados significativos entre tratamentos e não entre espécies, sendo a gramatura N.30 superior aos demais resultados. A intrusão radicular considera nulo, pois não houve nenhuma raiz aderida nos emissores.},

	abstract = {A identificação e mapeamento dos solos servem como subsidio para planejamentos agrícolas, levantamentos do uso da terra, estudos de terras para irrigação, estudos de preservação, análise e recuperação ambientais, predição de desastres naturais como o monitoramento de processos erosivos, dentre outros. Nesse sentido, os levantamentos e avaliações de solo, para fins agrícolas ou não, ganham importância, pois através deles é possível conhecer as propriedades desse recurso natural, permitindo sua utilização de forma consciente e adequada. O uso de sistemas de informações geográficas tem introduzido novos métodos para o levantamento e mapeamento de solos, por meio de modelagens, a partir da utilização de mapas temáticos básicos e modelos numéricos de terreno ou modelos digitais de elevação, que possibilitam, principalmente, a compreensão das relações entre a paisagem e as classes de solo. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi a realização do levantamento e mapeamento dos solos do município de Inconfidentes - MG, utilizando técnicas de geoprocessamento, e a classificação pedológica até o quarto nível categórico através da generalização, a partir da descrição morfológica e determinações analíticas de perfis de solos representativos. Foi realizada a caracterização da área de estudos, a aquisição e tratamento de dados cartográficos. A descrição morfológica dos perfis foi realizada em pontos previamente definidos, representativos das distintas classes de solo do município. As análises físico-químicas foram realizadas em todas as amostras dos horizontes dos perfis de solos coletados em campo. A generalização do levantamento de solos foi elaborada através do processamento dos dados cartográficos e obtidos em campo, com a utilização do software ArGIS 9.3. O mapeamento pedológico do município foi então o resultado da integração e correlação dos dados altimétricos, da declividade, da rede de drenagem, do canal fluvial, do relevo e da litologia, associados com a caracterização feita em campo e as determinações analíticas. Como resultado, foi possível mapear as áreas de ocorrência de Latossolos, Gleissolos e Cambissolos, as três ordens de solos mais representativos do município, classificando-os até o quarto nível categórico. O uso das ferramentas de geotecnologia se mostrou muito útil para a caracterização das classes pedológicas e posterior generalização, uma vez que através delas foi possível inferir as condições ambientais de formação dos solos e integrá-los com dados de campo e análises laboratoriais.   ABSTRACT  The identification and mapping of soils serve as subsidy for agricultural planning, land use surveys, land studies for irrigation, preservation studies, environmental analysis and recovery, prediction of natural disasters such as monitoring erosion, among others. In this sense, soil surveys and assessments, for agricultural purposes or not, become important because through them you can know the properties of this natural resource, allowing its use consciously and appropriately. The use of geographic information systems has introduced new methods to survey and soil mapping, through modeling, from the use of basic thematic maps and numerical terrain models and digital elevation models, which enable, especially, understanding the relationship between the landscape and the soil classes. The objective of this work was the completion of the survey and mapping of soils of city of Inconfidentes - MG, using geoprocessing techniques, and the pedological classification until the fourth categorical level by generalising from the morphological description and analytical profiles determinations representative soil. It was carried out to characterize their field of study, the acquisition and processing of cartographic data. The morphological description of the profiles was held in fixed locations, representative of the different soil classes of the municipality. The physicochemical analyzes were performed on all samples from the horizons of soil profiles collected in the field. Widespread soil survey was prepared by processing the cartographic data obtained in the field and, with the use of ArGIS 9.3 software. The pedological mapping of the municipality was then the result of the integration and correlation of altimetry data, the slope, the drainage network, the river channel, relief and lithology associated with the characterization made in the field and the analytical determinations. As a result, it was possible to map the areas of occurrence of Ferrasols, Cambisols and Gleysols, the three most representative soils of the municipality orders, sorting them until the fourth categorical level. The use of geotechnology tools proved very useful for the characterization of soil classes and subsequent generalization, since through them it was possible to infer the environmental conditions of soil formation and integrate them with field data and laboratory analysis.  Keywords: Cambisols, Gleysols, Ferrasols, classification, hillslope.},

					O processo de remoção de uma camada delgada euniforme do solo, provocada por escoamento difusodas águas pluviais é chamado de erosão laminar e estádiretamente associado com a estabilidade dasencostas. A erosividade é um índice numérico queexpressa a capacidade da chuva de causar erosão emuma área sem proteção e sua ação depende daintensidade, duração e frequência das chuvas. Ométodo mais utilizado no mundo para quantificar asperdas de solo é a Equação Universal de Perdas deSolo ou USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation), cujafórmula inclui a estimativa ou cálculo do fatorErosividade, R. A USLE é empregada para quantificara perda de solos em áreas pequenas, compatíveis como uso agrícola e sua variação ao longo do ano permiteidentificar a melhor época para se estabelecer práticasde manejo e conservação do solo. Em avaliação deáreas maiores, a USLE permite apenas avaliarqualitativamente os diferentes graus desusceptibilidade à erosão de áreas homogêneasidentificadas, não devendo ser empregada paraquantificar a perda de solos por erosão laminar esendo necessário o uso de ferramentas degeoprocessamento, como interpolações e álgebra demapas para complementar a análise em nível regional.},

Relationships between these properties and cotton yield can be obtained, indicating the crop potential for each soil condition. The objective of this study was to establish relationships between soil attributes that have spatial variability and its interference in cotton yield. The experiment was carried out in 5 6.1 ha, in Cristalina, GO, with cotton. Soil samples were collected on a regular grid of 80 x 80 m for evaluation of chemical and physical attributes and apparent electrical conductivity of soil (ECa). The cotton yield was measured by machines equipped with flow sensor during 2010/11 and 2011/12 cropping seasons. Cotton yield showed strong spatial dependence and has negative correlation with ECa and pH CaCl2. The ECa was an useful tool to identify the variability of acidity and soil nutrients in this study, allowing to delimit homogeneous zones to a distinct management.},

Para se chegar a esse modelo de agricultura, concentrador e pouco democrático, o Brasil precisou de quase cinco séculos. Durante a maior parte desse longo período, a agricultura não era vista como atividade nobre, ao contrário, procurava-se superar a identidade agrária, visto que a atividade não conferia status. Em certa medida, o Brasil teve vergonha de ser agrícola. Neste trabalho, o objetivo é analisar como o Brasil, um país agrário, durante mais de três séculos teve dificuldades de assumir uma identidade agrária, especialmente em função da influência de uma mentalidade portuguesa não afeita às lides agrícolas.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of traffic control in areas cultivated with sugarcane, regarding the soil physical quality, and the mechanical harvesting system with no straw burning (raw sugarcane). The project was developed in area cultivated with sugarcane including the following treatments: with traditional mechanized harvesting; with traffic control – augmented span; with traffic control augmented span and automatic driving. The soil physical attributes evaluated were the density, the macro and microporosity in layers from 0.00-0.10, 0.10-0.20 and 0.200.30m deep, in the row in entrerrodado under the wheels of sugarcane culture , as well as the least Limiting water range from 0.00 to 0.20m depth. The research was carried under a tri-factorial experimental design, with parcels subdivided into random block-type delineation. The minimum limiting water range verified that the management systems with traffic control had presented grater water availability to sugarcane crop.},

O experimento foi realizado, sob telado, na Faculdade de Agronomia e Medicina Veterinária da UFMT, em vasos de PVC rígido de 195 mm de diâmetro interno, adotando-se delineamento inteiramente casualizado em esquema fatorial 4 x 4 x 5 (quatro espécies, densidades do solo de 1,0; 1,2; 1,4 e 1,5 Mg m-3 e cinco repetições). O conteúdo de água no sistema solo/vaso foi mantido acima de 60 \% da capacidade de campo. Ao fim do experimento, mediu-se a altura das plantas, cortaram-se as plantas rente ao solo e foram determinadas a área foliar, a massa seca de frutificações (algodão, soja e milho) e a massa seca total da parte aérea. A compactação do solo provocou reduções significativas no crescimento da parte aérea do algodoeiro, milho e soja a partir de 1,4 Mg m-3 e na densidade do solo de 1,5 Mg m-3, para Brachiaria brizantha. A soja apresentou os maiores incrementos das características avaliadas na densidade do solo de 1,2 Mg m-3. A Brachiaria brizantha mostrou-se como a espécie de maior tolerância, enquanto o algodoeiro revelou maior susceptibilidade aos efeitos da compactação. Em geral, o modelo quadrático explicou adequadamente o crescimento das plantas de acordo com a compactação.

            Compaction is a process that can occur in soils managed inadequately, affecting crop growth and yield directly or indirectly. The shoot development was evaluated as a function of different degrees of subsoil compaction in soybean, corn, cotton, and Brachiaria brizantha plants grown in pots filled with soil material from a dystrophic Dark-Red Latosol, with water supply through subsurface irrigation. The experiment was carried out in screened greenhouse at the School of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine of UFMT, in rigid PVC pots with 195 mm internal diameter in a completely randomized design in a 4 × 5 factorial scheme (four species and five soil densities - 1.0; 1.2; 1.4; and 1.5 Mg m-3). The water content in the soil/pot system was maintained above 60\% of its maximum water retention capacity. At the end of the experiment, the plant height was measured and the plants cut at ground level; the leaf area estimated, and cotton, corn and soybean yield and the shoot dry matter evaluated. Soil densities above 1.4 Mg m-3 led to significant reduction in the development of shoot growth of cotton, corn, and soybean, while in Brachiaria brizantha plants the reduction was verified only at a density of 1.5 Mg m-3. Soybean presented the largest increment of the evaluated characteristics at a density of 1.2 Mg m-3. Brachiaria brizantha presented higher tolerance to compaction, whereas cotton plants were the most sensitive to effects of soil compaction. In general, the quadratic model adequately explained the growth of the studied plants as a function of soil compaction.},

Utilizou-se para tal, amostra de Latossolo Vermelho-Escuro álico, textura média, do município de Uberlândia, MG, previamente calcareado e adubado. Os vasos utilizados, foram formados pela sobreposição de três anéis de PVC, com 1,5 dm de diâmetro e altura de 0,5 dm para o anel central e inferior e 1,25 dm para o anel superior, unidos por fita adesiva. O solo do anel central foi submetido a diferentes níveis de compactação para obter as densidades de 1,15; 1,30; 1,45; 1,60 kg dm-3. Metade do solo utilizado foi previamente desinfestado, com 0,25 dm3 m-3 de brometo de metila. Formada a coluna, pela união dos três anéis com fita adesiva foi plantada soja IAC-8, com sementes previamente desinfestadas e inoculadas com as estirpes de rizóbios SEMIA 5079 e SEMIA 5080. As estirpes nativas encontravam-se no solo utilizado. Quarenta e sete dias após a emergência, as plantas de soja foram cortadas rente ao solo, secadas em estufa de ventilação forçada, pesada e submetidas à digestão para determinação do nitrogênio. As colunas de PVC foram desmontadas para coleta e quantificação de raízes e nódulos de rizóbios. Análise e interpretação dos dados possibilitaram constatar que a produção de matéria seca da parte aérea da soja foi crescente com a desinfestação do solo e inoculação com a estirpe de rizóbio SEMIA 5080, dentro das densidades de até 1,30 kg dm-3. Para valores maiores do que este, as estirpes estudadas não diferiram entre si. A compactação, por outro lado, promoveu reduções lineares na produção da matéria seca da parte aérea no solo desinfestado, e, parabólica, com maior produção na densidade de 1,35 kg dm-3 no solo não desinfestado. A concentração de nitrogênio na parte aérea da soja foi significativamente menor com a inoculação menor com a inoculação da estirpe SEMIA 5079 no solo desinfestado, enquanto que, no não desinfestado as estirpes estudadas não diferiram entre si. A compactação aplicada reduziu linearmente a concentração de nitrogênio. Com a desinfestação do solo a maior produção ocorreu com a presença da estirpe nativa. Por outro lado, a compactação produziu efeito parabólico na produção de raízes tanto no solo desinfestado como no solo não desinfestado, com pontos de máxima produção nas densidades 1,47 kg dm-3 e 1,61 kg dm-3, respectivamente. A desinfestação do solo aumentou significativamente a massa dos nódulos em todos os níveis de compactação, enquanto que não houve efeito da estirpe inoculada. Por outro lado, a compactação promoveu aumentos da massa dos nódulos até a densidade do solo de 1,33 kg dm-3 em todas as estirpes inoculadas. Enquanto a desinfestação do solo possibilitou aumentos no número de nódulos, a inoculação não foi significativa. A compactação promoveu redução linear no número de nódulos no solo desinfestado e aumento linear no solo não desinfestado em todas as estirpes estudadas},

Thermal analysis of the fibers was done by the DTG and DSC technique. The moisture desorption was observed at a lower temperature in the case of all the treated fibers, which might be a result of the increased fineness of the fibers, which provides more surface area for moisture evaporation. The decrease in percentage moisture loss for the fibers treated with alkali for 6 and 8 h could be the result of the increased crystallinity of the fibers. The percentage degradation of the hemicellulose decreased considerably in all the treated fibers, conforming to the fact that the hemicellulose content was lowered on alkali treatment. The decomposition temperature for a-cellulose was lowered to 348degreesC from 362.2degreesC for all the treated fibers, and the residual char formation increased to a significant extent. The enthalpy for the thermal degradation of a-cellulose showed a decreasing trend for the fibers treated for 2 and 4 h, which could be caused by the initial loosening of the structure, followed by an increase in the enthalpy value in the case of the 6- and 8-h-alkali-treated fibers resulting from increased crystallinity, as evident from the X-ray diffraction.

THSPs generated by numerical simulations, obtained in a controlled drying of paint experiment and in dead and alive bean seeds under laser illumination were evaluated. We used first- and second-order statistics of the dynamic speckle patterns for different time and spatial amounts of data. We have tested both square and rectangular windows in the space time domain.

Methods: Using several different methods of historical analysis, the two most common views on well-child care are presented: the positivist one, whose foundation is essentially based upon historical facts, and that of social criticism, concerned with how historical facts are inserted in society at different levels.
Results: The coexistence of two distinct views on well-child care reveals two conflicting ideologies, but it does not invalidate the two different types of knowledge.
Conclusions: Even though the understanding of well-child care through a historical approach does not allow for definitive conclusions on what it is or what it will be, it encourages reflections on more practical meanings, namely: the possibility to consider practices that gather an ensemble of positive knowledge without disregarding their limitations, and the formulation of well-child care practices concerned with social care, determined by several aspects, instead of by ideological interest.},

O presente estudo procurou desrever como utilizar o Business Model Generation em aulas de empreendedorismo, objetivando apresentar a metodologia utilizada para aplicar o modelo em sala de aula e a percepção dos alunos sobre o uso de um modelo prático durante o aprendizado. A fundamentação teórica realizada versou o modelo em si e seus antecedentes, sendo na sequência descrita a aplicação do Business Model Generation na disciplina de empreendedorismo na Faculdade de Economia e Administração da Universidade de São Paulo. Foi realizada uma pesquisa qualitativa com os grupos de alunos, no total quatorze, verificando-se que os mesmos aprovaram a iniciativa, sendo ressaltados pontos fortes e fracos da utilização do modelo em sala de aula. Além disso, apresentou-se a percepção dos docentes sobre a utilização do modelo. Trata-se de um estudo descritivo, qualitativo, considerado como um caso de ensino. Poderá contribuir com docentes de graduação na decisão de utilizar o modelo em sala de aula, além de promover o início de pesquisas de temas relacionados ao modelo, uma vez que ainda são poucos os esforços acadêmicos realizados nesse sentido.
ABSTRACT
The present study sought to describe how to use the Business Model Generation in entrepreneurship classes, aiming to present the methodology used to apply the model in the classroom and students’ perceptions about the use of a practical model for learning. A review of the literature was about the model itself and its background and then described in the application of the Business Model Generation in the discipline of entrepreneurship at the Faculdade de Economia e Administração, Universidade de São Paulo. Qualitative interviews were conducted with groups of students, in the total of fourteen, verifying that they approved the initiative and highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the application of the model in the classroom. In addition, was presented the perception of teachers on the use of the model. This is a descriptive, qualitative study, considered as a teaching case. It may contribute to undergraduate teaching in the decision to use the model in a classroom, and promote the initiation of research on issues related to the model, since there are few academic efforts made in this direction.},

For this, the following specific objectives were established: to outline the profile of the management students of the studied institution; Mapping the entrepreneurial behavioral characteristics of these academics; And propose actions to improve these characteristics. The research, with a quantitative and descriptive methodological approach, obtained a sample of 374 students responding to the McClelland CCE’S questionnaire, allowing the identification of deficiencies in the characteristics “persistence”, “taking calculated risks”, “goal setting” and “persuasion and networks Of contact”. Thus, it is suggested that the governing bodies of this university encourage the creation of programs and projects that stimulate the development of the entrepreneurial behavior of its students, in view of the relevance of the entrepreneur’s role in society.},

Algumas estratégias metodológicas de ensino diferenciadas vêm sendo desenvolvidas por professores, que acreditam ser possível promover mudanças em suas práticas pedagógicas, tendo em vista uma aprendizagem significativa. A Aprendizagem Baseada em Problemas (ABP) surge como uma dessas estratégias de método inovadoras em que os estudantes trabalham com o objetivo de solucionar um problema real ou simulado a partir de um contexto. Trata-se, portanto, de um método de aprendizagem centrado no aluno, que deixa o papel de receptor passivo do conhecimento e assume o lugar de protagonista de seu próprio aprendizado por meio da pesquisa. Este artigo constitui-se em uma revisão da literatura básica sobre a Aprendizagem Baseada em Problemas. O objetivo é apresentar a ABP como um método de aprendizagem significativo e eficaz, que pode ser utilizado nos diversos níveis de ensino e nas mais diferentes disciplinas. Por meio de uma investigação do estado da arte sobre a ABP, buscamos refletir acerca da sua importância como método de aprendizagem. A ABP tem apresentado resultados positivos, observados por pesquisadores das mais diferentes áreas, os quais a utilizaram como método de aprendizagem, seja em cursos universitários, seja na educação básica. Espera-se, com este artigo, possibilitar a reflexão sobre novas estratégias de aprendizagem para um ensino educativo.},

	abstract = {Digital media plays an essential role in the area of Environmental Education. This study intends to propose an activity involving media in environmental education. The participants came from a Technical Teacher Training school in the municipality of Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This city has been suffering with environmental damages and precariousness in the supply of water and sewage treatment, in addition to the excessive amount of solid waste thrown on the beaches in the high season. Among these, coconut waste. Faced with this situation, a thematic proposal was developed with the students, comprising an interactive lecture about different ways of reusing solid coconut waste and about the harmful implications when it is released to the environment. In order to accompany learning, a playful activity was performed using the mobile device feature in the Kahoot! application. Students were then asked to answer a questionnaire in an interactive and collaborative way. It is therefore possible to understand the success of this kind of playful activities and its possibilities, associated to games using mobile devices, in the context of the teaching-learning process. It can be concluded that the media-education through mobile devices improves cognitive development, autonomy, creativity and enables an eminent awareness about social-environmental problems.},

Além disso, permite que os cálculos necessários sejam expressos dentro do contexto familiar da álgebra matricial o que facilita a implementação em software estatístico. Além disso, devido à simplicidade e eficácia para lidar com diferentes problemas de suavização semiparamétrica, a regressão funcional (Spline, Fourier, etc.) recentemente se tornou uma ferramenta popular para resolver vários problemas de estimativa nas mais variadas ciências. Neste artigo, usamos um estudo de simulação para comparar um método com nós equidistantes em um modelo de spline de regressão com um modelo de base Fourier.

	abstract = {This study investigates the way the growth ideology deals with the contradictions of sustainable development discourse. Reports from newspapers were analyzed, which linked state-owned companies and companies of mixed economy operating in the business of electricity generation and listed in the ISE BM\&FBOVESPA to the dimensions of sustainable development of the Triple Bottom Line (3BL). Also, the sustainability reports of those companies were analyzed. The data collected is dated from 2005 to 2013. The media reports underwent content analysis aiming to find reported facts that linked those enterprises to the sustainable development themes. The reports of sustainability underwent discourse analysis with the purpose of identifying ideological demonstrations in the sustainability discourse. Using Giddens’s (1979) conceptualization of ‘ideology’, the results indicated that the growth ideology components are transferred to the discourse of sustainable development through euphemisms and semantic slips. This allows companies to take advantage of the polysemous properties of language to re-signify them by (i) the reification of the present; (ii) the defense of growth as if it were of primary collective interest, and (iii) the denial of contradictions, evidenced by conflicts between the environmental, economic and social dimensions of the Triple Bottom Line concept.},

The methodology was chosen descriptive research through a survey of quantitative data approach. Therefore, data collection used the survey instrument proposed by Carland and Carland (1996) consists of 33 pairs of closed questions that measure the pontecial entrepreneur through four dimensions: personality traits (TP), propensity to innovation (PI), propensity to risk (PR) and the strategic posture (PE). In the data analysis spreadsheets and descriptive statistics. The results show that among the students surveyed identified the presence of the potential entrepreneur as the scale of the ERC in its four dimensions. We also observed the predominance of entrepreneurial category present in 81.46\% of respondents, followed by the microenterprise category with 17.56\% and the category macro entrepreneur with 0.97\%. These findings further confirm the results of other empirical studies that applied the CIS in different cultural contexts.},

A abordagem qualitativa foi adotada utilizando a pesquisa documental e análise de conteúdo de documentos disponíveis para operacionalizar a pesquisa. Foi identificado que o Brasil utiliza a abordagem middleup-down, que favorece a interação entre múltiplos atores no processo, diferentemente da abordagem top-down, que segue o modelo internacional divulgado.},

O estudo partiu de uma pesquisa bibliográfica e qualitativa a respeito dos cenários que influenciam o crescimento desse tipo de empresa. Essas empresas possuem alternativas de fomentos de investidores e até programas governamentais. Inicialmente foi realizada uma pesquisa bibliográfica para compreensão do ecossistema no qual as startups estão inseridas e suas características. Para se entender os fatores de crescimento desses empreendimenos, optou-se pelo levantamento em banco de dados e técnicas infométricas, como o acompanhamento de buscar em sites de busca (Google Trends). Conclui-se que o aumento no número de startups no Brasil deve-se ao cenário favorável encontrado, tanto da parte dos investidores quanto pelo governo. Assim, para que uma startup possa ter sucesso é preciso mais do que uma ideia inovadora. É necessário que haja um trabalho de gestão da inovação sistemático e uma sólida fundamentação teórica interligada.},

In this paper, in-situ shear tests of the ground with the vetiver roots have been conducted to investigate the stabilization properties corresponding to the embankment slopes. Numerical analyses have also been performed with the finite element method using elastoplastic subloading t(ij) model, which can simulate typical soil behavior. It is revealed from field tests that the shear strength of vetiver rooted soil matrix is higher than that of the unreinforced soil. The reinforced soil with vetiver root also shows ductile behavior. The numerical analyses capture well the results of the in-situ shear tests. Effectiveness of vetiver root in geotechnical structures-strip foundation and embankment slope has been evaluated by finite element analyses. It is found that the reinforcement with vetiver root enhances the bearing capacities of the grounds and stabilizes the embankment slopes.},

Com base em 248 amostras de empreendedor acadêmico, os resultados empíricos indicam que a relação entre a identificação empresarial e o desempenho do empreendedorismo acadêmico é positiva. Além do que, além do mais, o relacionamento acima mencionado é negativamente moderado pela inércia do capital social, enquanto positivamente moderado pela narrativa empreendedora. Além disso, a identificação empreendedora é melhor para o desempenho do empreendedorismo acadêmico no contexto de baixos níveis de inércia do capital social e altos níveis de narrativa empreendedora.

	abstract = {The current online digital world, consisting of thousands of newspapers, blogs, social media, and cloud file sharing services, is providing easy and unlimited access to a large treasure of text contents. Making copies of these text contents is simple and virtually costless. As a result, producers and owners of text content are interested in the protection of their intellectual property (IP) rights. Digital watermarking has become crucially important in the protection of digital contents. Out of all, text watermarking poses many challenges, since text is characterized by a low capacity to embed a watermark and allows only a restricted number of alternative syntactic and semantic permutations. This becomes even harder when authors want to protect not just a whole book or article, but each single sentence or paragraph, a problem well known to copyright law. In this paper, we present a fine-grain text watermarking method that protects even small portions of the digital content. The core method is based on homoglyph characters substitution for latin symbols and whitespaces. It allows to produce a watermarked version of the original text, preserving the anonymity of the users according to the right to privacy. In particular, the embedding and extraction algorithms allow to continuously protect the watermark through the whole document in a fine-grain fashion. It ensures visual indistinguishability and length preservation, meaning that it does not cause overhead to the original document, and it is robust to the copy and past of small excerpts of the text. We use a real dataset of 1.8 million New York articles to evaluate our method. We evaluate and compare the robustness against common attacks, and we propose a new measure for partial copy and paste robustness. The results show the effectiveness of our approach providing an average length of 101 characters needed to embed the watermark and allowing to protect paragraph-long excerpt or smaller the 94.5\% of the times.},

In this article, they are named intentional founders. The study is a survey complemented by a short literature review. The online questionnaire was answered by 12,604 Brazilian students from 37 public and private higher-education institutions. According to their answers, they present a higher demand for entrepreneurship education and a higher entrepreneurial intention than students from other countries. Three hypotheses were tested. Results show that more or less entrepreneurship education (EE) has no effect on students’ entrepreneurial intention and self-efficacy (self-perception of being wellprepared to do successful entrepreneurial activities). On the other hand, entrepreneurial intention has a significant and positive association with demand for EE. Taking advantage of students’ high demand seems attractive to facilitate the necessary improvement of EE in Brazil. The discussions and conclusions at the end of the paper offer recommendations not only for the improvement of higher education, but also for conducting further research.},

The focus is on the context of cultural entrepreneurship and rely on empirical research carried out with undergraduate students in Management of the Federal University of Sergipe. The results of the research define and discuss four key dimensions of experience (dynamism, reflection, integration and freedom) in the process of entrepreneurial education. Thus, the results contribute to improve the theoretical understanding that drive research on entrepreneurial education. Consequently, it provides possibilities to better qualification of educators concerned by how to educate future entrepreneurs.},

Characterized as a case study, this research was conducted through field research with a qualitative approach. Data collection was carried out following a semi-structured script, analyzed through the Collective Subject Discourse technique. It was found that the managers of the research institution follow the trend of innovative and creative management and appear to be aware of the importance of entrepreneurial management in universities, and also of what is needed and what hinders its implementation.

	abstract = {This research deals with the construction and application of a didactic sequence for entrepreneurship education in the school of elementary school students. The objective of the study is to analyze the process of elaboration, implementation and evaluation of a teaching sequence that address the topic Entrepreneurship, and allow entrepreneurship education and development of entrepreneurial behavior in elementary school students. These students have a lack of activities that encourage entrepreneurial behavior, an important requirement for survival in life and in the competitive world of current job. The operational objectives of this research were: to understand the entrepreneurial process in its behavioral approach, and contribute to the construction of entrepreneurial behavior in the formation of Brazilian students, analyze the variables of the validity of educational teaching sequence product developed for the Professional Master. The theoretical basis of this research consisted in the approaches of entrepreneurship, the importance of playfulness in the learning process and rationale of the didactic sequence. It was used as a research strategy to action research that allows researchers to work directly in the improvement proposed by the research for data collection was used questionnaires open to students of State College Durval Ramos Filho, the city of Andirá - PR. The results obtained through qualitative research demonstrated that the product is a possibility of entrepreneurial behavior development, but must be associated with an entrepreneurial education in fact, because the teaching sequence alone will achieve no success in training entrepreneurs.},

Este livro, resultante de um projeto de investigação - Aprendizagens empreendedoras, cooperação e mercado de trabalho: boas práticas no ensino superior (POAT/FSE) -, remete-nos para uma discussão sobre as dinâmicas de parcerias construídas em torno do empreendedorismo no contexto das Instituições do Ensino Superior. Os objetivos definidos permitiram fazer o mapeamento dos programas, projetos de empreendedorismo e infraestruturas de suporte existentes (2007-2013), a identificação de um conjunto de "boas práticas" e a elaboração de um reportório de competências empreendedoras consideradas relevantes para apoiar os jovens na transição para o mercado de trabalho.},

Para os concretizar, foi conduzido um estudo quantitativo, transversal, observacional e analítico no qual participaram 598 alunos. A recolha de dados decorreu em novembro e dezembro de 2012 e envolveu o uso do questionário Entrepreneurial Potential Indicator. A maioria dos respondentes era do género feminino (61,0\%); tinha entre 18 e 21 anos (53,8\%) a que corresponde uma média de 22,6 anos (±4,59); estudava em regime ordinário (82,6\%); vinha da região Norte (83,9\%), vivia em meio urbano (53,8\%), frequentava o 1º ciclo de estudos (92,8\%) de duas áreas científicas, designadamente, ciências da educação (28,4\%) e tecnologia e gestão (28,4\%) . Mais de metade dos inquiridos apresentou competências empreendedoras (72,4\%). Dos fatores de capital humano considerados, o regime de frequência foi o único fator que mostrou não ter qualquer tipo de influência no potencial empreendedor. De fato, os outros fatores de capital humano considerados, nomeadamente, a área científica do curso e o ciclo de estudos revelaram ser fatores que contribuem para o reforço ou desenvolvimento das competências empreendedoras nos estudantes. Nenhum dos fatores sociodemográficos considerados revelou ser fator diferenciador do potencial empreendedor. A regressão logística binária (modelo logit) revelou a existência de uma relação de causa e efeito entre todas as características com a propensão empreendedora.

The human capital factors considered, the frequency regime was the only factor that showed no any influence on the entrepreneurial potential. In fact, the other human capital factors considered 
in particular the scientific area of the course and the course of study proved to be factors that contribute to the strengthening or development of entrepreneurial skills in students. None of the sociodemographic factos considered proved to be a differentiating factor of entrepreneurial potential.

There are multiple entrepreneurship measurement scales; however, most of them are aimed at corporate evaluation. This study intends to analyze the psychometric properties of the Opportunities and Resources for Entrepreneurship scale in a sample of university students, focusing on factors that influence entrepreneurial behaviors. The sample consisted of 6,532 polytechnic university students. The sample was randomly divided into two equal-sized groups. An exploratory factor analysis was run using one subgroup, from which four factors emerged: F1-Resource Availability, F2-Business Stability, F3-Economic and Political Instability, and F4-Business Opportunities. A confirmatory factor analysis was then done using the other subgroup, which showed acceptable goodness-of-fit levels. This study demonstrated the psychometric robustness of the instrument under analysis, as well as that students perceive environmental factors as important variables that promote entrepreneurship in Portugal.},

As per F-policy, when the system reaches its full capacity K, no further failed machines are allowed to join the system until the system size ceases down to a prespecified threshold value F. To deal with general reattempts made by a failed machine from the orbit for the repair, the supplementary variable corresponding to retrial times is used to construct the steady-state governing equations, and then explicit formulae for the queue size probability distributions are derived by using Laplace transform and recursive method. A fuzzy cost function is formulated by considering the cost elements as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and then α − cut approach is implemented to develop lower and upper bounds of the cost elements. In order to defuzzify the cost function, the signed distance method is used. The genetic algorithm is applied to determine the optimal control parameter and corresponding minimum cost of the system.},

Para tanto, desenvolveu-se uma análise de conteúdo acerca dos conceitos presentes nos livros-texto de metodologia além de fontes complementares, buscando identificar o que são, que objetivo têm e de que formas se apresentam esses quatro tipos de textos. Nesse sentido, verificou-se, na literatura, que há características partilhadas por esses diferentes tipos de textos, que os tornam iguais, bem como que há características que os distinguem, tornando-os únicos. A pesquisa bibliográfica apresenta-se, na literatura, como mais flexível, podendo, inclusive, ser apenas parte da pesquisa empírica, e ser apresentada na forma de um capítulo de tese ou dissertação. A pesquisa bibliométrica precisa, necessariamente, contemplar uma etapa de análise quantitativa de dados. O artigo de revisão tem como característica principal a sistematicidade com a qual o material bibliográfico é coletado e analisado. Tanto a pesquisa bibliográfica quanto o artigo de revisão, usualmente, são apresentados conforme estrutura de pesquisa empírica. O ensaio, por sua vez, distancia-se dos outros três, pois independe de evidências empíricas, de análises quantitativas, de sistematicidade em sua construção e, por possuir uma estrutura amorfa. A qualidade do ensaio decorre da originalidade e do ineditismo de sua proposição.},

In this paper we describe how we can apply technology mining techniques to these diverse information sources to study, visualize and identify the evolution of promising new technologies – what we refer to as “early growth technology analysis.” For the work reported herein, we use as sources the information about millions of published documents contained in the SCIRCUS, Inspec, and Compendix sources. We accomplish our analysis through the use of bibliometric data mining analysis, consisting of three key steps: 1. Identify related keywords (from keywords in articles) 2.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the mechanical resistance to the penetration of a Red Latosol and the comparison of two penetrometers with model adjustments and moisture correction. The experiment was carried out from May to October 2018, at the Federal University of Mato Grosso - UFMT, Campus university de Rondonópolis - CUR. Between the 0-20 cm layer some physical soil properties such as density, porosity and soil penetration resistance were evaluated. For the comparison of the two penetrometers, field and laboratory evaluations were carried out and the laboratory evaluations were determined through the collection of samples in the layer between 0-60 cm. In the determination of the penetration resistance correction for standard moisture two methods of Busscher and an alternative were compared. The data obtained from mechanical resistance of the soil in the laboratory were submitted to four models of adjustments, being the model of Jakobsen e Dexter (1987) that obtained better adjustment to the data. There is significant divergence in the values of resistance to penetration for the same range of humidity when compared the values obtained by the two apparatuses presenting the field evaluation smaller values. For a standard moisture of 20\% the data of soil mechanical resistance to measured penetration and reference resistance showed a positive correlation.},

	abstract = {AbstratoA energia, o momentum e as trocas de massa entre o solo e a atmosfera ocorrem na camada superficial. A diferença entre a temperatura da tela do ar a 2 m (T2) e a temperatura da superfície terrestre (LST) é um parâmetro chave na sua determinação. Aqui, uma análise dessa diferença é feita com dados de um site na ilha de Maiorca, no Mediterrâneo Ocidental. Enquanto estudos prévios são freqüentemente construídos para intervalos temporais relativamente curtos (de vários dias a poucos meses), o trabalho atual analisa séries de 2 anos de duração com uma resolução temporal de 30 minutos, em particular a variabilidade sazonal e diurna. A incerteza de LST medida perto do solo é estimada em pelo menos 2 ∘∘{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}C. A diferença entre T2 e LST (T2-LST) no centro do dia varia entre - 3 e - 10 ∘∘{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}C, chegando a cerca de - 18 ∘∘{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}C para os dias secos de verão. Estatisticamente, é mostrado que estes valores estão relacionados com o aquecimento da radiação da superfície transmitida para cima pela turbulência térmica. Os valores no verão são muito maiores porque o solo seco superior não permite que o calor seja transmitido eficientemente ao solo. À noite T2-LST é geralmente menos de 3 ∘∘{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}C, com correlações fracas de T2-LST com radiação líquida ou fluxo no solo, indicando que estes processos são ativos e eficientes no transporte de calor na maioria dos casos. As melhores quantidades correlacionadas à noite com T2-LST são a temperatura do solo superior, o LST e o fluxo de calor turbulento, refletindo a importância do estado da superfície. Nas noites de verão T2-LST leva valores muito pequenos, abaixo de 1 ∘∘{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}C, mesmo permitindo estratificação instável. Este é o resultado de um solo no qual os primeiros centímetros são muito quentes após o pôr do sol, não sendo capazes de enviar calor para o solo seco e liberá-lo na atmosfera.},

	abstract = {Resumo: Esta pesquisa apresenta o estudo do quebra-mar flutuante de garrafa plástica cuja aplicação é reduzir a altura das ondas no litoral ou margem. A motivação do desenvolvimento deste conceito é a constante busca por alternativas ecológicas para proteção costeira. Pesquisas e estudos realizados para estruturas flutuantes não convencionais serviram de material e embasamento para o desenvolvimento do quebra-mar apresentado. O objetivo da pesquisa é desenvolver um quebra-mar flutuante ecológico de fácil construção. A metodologia utilizada foi modelagem física, portanto realizou-se a definição dos materiais, a construção do modelo e os testes do modelo. Antes dos ensaios com onda um gabião preenchido com garrafas foi testado em relação à deformação em um tanque de água. Os testes no canal de onda foram realizados variando-se a onda, a profundidade e a submergência do modelo. A fase seguinte foi de dimensionamentos de protótipos com dados reais para chegar a um roteiro de cálculo. O modelo físico reduzido é construído a partir de garrafas plásticas descartadas unitizadas por gabiões que são conectados. A estrutura é posicionada através de ancoragem à fundação no solo. No teste estático conclui-se sobre o preenchimento com água de algumas garrafas para minimizar o empuxo e, portanto, evitar deformação desnecessária. Os ensaios com ondas demonstraram redução significativa na altura de onda, principalmente quando a estrutura está submersa. Neste posicionamento, grande parte da energia da onda incidente é refletida e dissipada por percolação e arrebentação por cima da estrutura. A construção deste quebra-mar é modular sendo cada gabião um módulo que será conectado aos restantes depois de preenchido. Os módulos são preenchidos em terreno seco e então transportados para o local de implantação. Recomenda-se fortemente o uso quebra-mar flutuante de garrafa plástica para corpos d¿água com ondas curtas, pois a eficiência deste é otimizada quando o comprimento da onda é menor que o comprimento da obra},

This article explores the combination of mechanisms used by ﬁrms in Andalusia, a peripheral region in Spain and Europe, when interacting with universities. Using information from a survey of 737 innovative ﬁrms, the empirical study found evidence that university–industry links can be grouped into ﬁve latent dimensions (knowledge generation and adaptation, involvement in new organisations, training and exchange of human resources, intellectual property rights, and facilities and equipment) which are mainly based on exploitation or exploration activities. A typology of ﬁrms was created, highlighting the large number of ﬁrms with no interactions, and six clusters that specialize in speciﬁc mechanisms (IPR exploiters, Institutionalized interactors, University facility users, Training and education beneﬁciaries, Tacit knowledge users, and R\&D interactors). The study also presents the determinants for engaging in each type of channel, concluding that whilst ﬁrms developing exploitation activities also develop parallel exploration activities, the reverse is not signiﬁcant. The absorptive capacity of ﬁrms is important in determining the type of interaction, but is not fully conclusive about the range of exploration and exploitation activities. The article ends by discussing the policy implications associated with incentives to adapt knowledge transfer mechanisms to the industrial fabric of peripheral innovation systems.},

Foram amostradas 18 árvores, distribuídas em 6 classes diamétricas, com coleta de amostras, de casca e madeira, nas seguintes alturas relativas (por cento da altura total): h0,1 (10\%), h0,3 (30\%), h0,5 (50\%), h0,7 (70\%) e h0,9 (90\%). O padrão de alocação dos nutrientes ao longo do tronco foi estudado mediante comparação de médias e ajuste de equações de regressão, correlacionando concentração de nutrientes e a altura de coleta das amostras. Testaram-se diferentes estimadores da concentração de nutrientes: teor médio aritmético (TM), teor médio ponderado pelo diâmetro da secção (TMPD) e teor médio ponderado pela biomassa da secção (TMPB); tendo este como tratamento padrão. Com exceção de Mn e Ca na madeira, todos os nutrientes apresentaram maior teor na porção superior do tronco (h0,9), podendo ser para P 2,7 vezes superior na madeira e 5 vezes superior na casca, em relação a base do tronco (h0,1). O elemento Ca na madeira apresentou comportamento inverso, ou seja, maior teor na base do tronco (h0,1); enquanto Mn não diferiu estatisticamente entre os pontos de coleta. Entre os estimadores da concentração de nutrientes testados, o TM apresentou os maiores valores, exceto para Ca na madeira, o que acarreta superestimação do estoque de nutrientes. Para as condições do estudo, considerando o TMPB como melhor estimador da concentração de nutrientes, o intervalo de confiança para altura relativa de coleta de amostras foi estimado em 35 – 53\% para madeira e 38 – 46\% para casca.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the quantity and quality of the material lost by soil erosion due to soil management is a basic need to identify land management zones in catchments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soil management on the quantity and quality of soil material lost by erosion in the Posses sub-watershed, Municipality of Extrema, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Water and sediments lost by natural rainfall erosion were sampled from erosion plots located on a Red-Yellow Argisol (PVA) under the following systems: bare soil, subsistence farming (maize/beans/pumpkin/jack-beans/fallow), degraded pasture, well-managed pasture, and reforestation set up in 2013; and in a Litholic Neosol (RL): reforestation set up in 2008, bare soil, and native forest. Ca, Mg, K, P, N and soil organic matter (SOM) contents were determined in sediment and soil samples (at 0-5 cm depth) for the determination of the runoff enrichment ratios. Management influences soil losses more so than water losses. Minor losses were found in reforestation set up in 2013 (soil); in well-managed pasture (water); and in reforestations (nutrients and SOM). These losses tend to stability with time. The general sequence of nutrient losses was N {\textgreater} Ca {\textgreater} Mg {\textgreater} K {\textgreater} P in PVA; and N {\textgreater} Ca {\textgreater} K {\textgreater} Mg {\textgreater} P in RL. Loss rates of SOM and N followed the order: bare soil {\textgreater} subsistence farming {\textgreater} degraded pasture {\textgreater} well-managed pasture {\textgreater} reforestation, in PVA; and bare soil {\textgreater} native forest {\textgreater} reforestation, in RL. Reforestation and well-management pasture are effective conservation strategies in order to lower the erosion process in the Posses sub-watershed. Soil losses, as well as nutrients and organic matter losses were more influenced by soil management than water losses. The safeguarding native forest under Litholic Neosol is essential to the conservation of this pedoenvironment, especially in steep slopes.},

	abstract = {The interpretation of airports as places where landings and take-offs occur is obsolete. Globalisation, the ?mobility era? and a so-called ?culture-cognitive capitalism,? favour the reconceptualisation of airports and may turn them into necessary infrastructures for every city that aspires to be ?global.? An airport?city symbiosis is analysed and is defined from a multidimensional perspective (operative, economic, and symbolic). These perspectives have led to important works of expansion and renovation of airport facilities and a multiplication of the services that may be developed within them. The results show this multidimensional symbiosis in general, although it is analysed in detail for the Spanish case study of the Adolfo Suarez-Madrid Barajas Airport, which is the main air gateway of Spain to the rest of the world and the most important European hub connecting Latin America with Europe. Its global exposure is reflected in its ability to stimulate the economic and residential development of its surroundings and to strengthen the modern image of Madrid, thanks to morphological changes and increases in non-aeronautical uses, which are viewed as city marketing initiatives that help to promote Madrid in the world urban hierarchy.},

Ao mesmo tempo, Freire esperançadamente afirma a história como possibilidade e não como determinismo, marca a diferença entre treinamento e formação, condena os dogmatismos, inclusive os dos partidos políticos progressistas e reacionários; formaliza a dialética da unidade na diversidade, mas sobretudo e veementemente, recusa a "morte da História, da utopia, dos sonhos". Ainda nos fala da sua experiência do exílio. As reflexões políticas e éticas, postas com beleza e sabedoria em todos os momentos da escrita do À sombra desta mangueira a faz uma obra fundamental, não apenas para os profissionais da educação, que sabem que "o domínio técnico é tão importante para o profissional quanto a compreensão política o é para o cidadão" e que ambas as formações cabem aos educadores/as, mas também é fundamental àqueles que acreditam num mundo mais justo, verdadeiramente democrático, onde a formação técnica, científica e profissional seja tão importante quanto o sonho e a utopia.

	abstract = {Os agricultores nas áreas costeiras afetadas por sal do leste da Índia enfrentam desafios de inundação, salinidade, escassez de água de irrigação e chuvas insuficientes que afetam a produção agrícola e a sustentabilidade ambiental. Este estudo avaliou três métodos de estabelecimento de arroz [arroz seco semeado (DSR), arroz transplantado não ensopado (não PTR) e arroz transplantado (PTR)] durante a estação chuvosa / kharif e três práticas de preparo do solo [semeadura direta ( ZT), preparo convencional (CT) e semeadura em canteiros (RBS)] para culturas de seca / rabi (milho e colza) em um experimento replicado. O local experimental foi na área de planície costeira de West Bengal, com efeito de sequeiro e de água salgada, e o arroz foi cultivado em três estações húmidas sucessivas (2013–16), com cada cultura de arroz seguida de milho ou colza na estação seca. O arroz transplantado foi afetado negativamente pela submersão a cada ano devido à forte chuva após o transplante, enquanto o DSR foi menos afetado, pois as plantas eram mais altas no momento em que as fortes chuvas começaram. Os rendimentos de grãos de arroz foram semelhantes (4,5–5,1 t ha −1 ), no entanto, entre os três métodos de estabelecimento de arroz, e, além disso, os rendimentos de arroz não foram afetados pelas práticas de plantio direto da estação da raiva. Os retornos líquidos e a relação custo-benefício (BCR) foram maiores no DSR devido aos custos reduzidos de preparação da terra. A colza cultivada após arroz não envasado (DSR e não-PTR) deu um rendimento 25-44\% maior do que a colza cultivada após PTR, e os rendimentos de milho foram 8–13\% maiores quando cultivados após DSR ou não-PTR do que após PTR . DSR e Non-PTR também tiveram efeitos positivos na qualidade do solo: a densidade do solo foi menor após a colheita do arroz no terceiro ano e a salinidade do solo diminuiu durante cada estação seca (dezembro a abril) logo após a cultura do arroz. A produção de milho foi mais alta na ERB (5,8 t ha −1 ), seguida pela CT (4,1 t ha −1 ) e ZT (3,6 t ha −1 ), enquanto a colza produziu a maior produção sob ZT (0,86 t ha −1 ) -à-vis RBS e CT (0,6 t ha- 1 ). Os retornos líquidos para o milho foram maiores com as safras na RBS e na colza com ZT. O milho proporcionou um retorno econômico maior do que a colza (US \$ 301-405 ha- 1 em milho; US \$ 5-113 ha- 1 em colza), mas exigiu 25 cm a mais de água de irrigação e 3 GJ ha- 1 a mais de energia. cultivo. Este estudo indica que o arroz-milho poderia ser mais lucrativo do que a colza para as áreas costeiras afetadas pelo sal na Índia, e que, para melhorar a produtividade e a lucratividade nessa rotação, o arroz deveria ser estabelecido como DSR ou Não-PTR seguido de milho na RBS nas regiões costeiras.},

Um relatório da Conferência de Comércio e Desenvolvimento das Nações Unidas (UNCTAD) [2] publicado há quase uma década propõe um entendimento a partir de quatro categorias profissionais abrangentes para abrigar as profissões da indústria criativa: herança, artes, mídia, e criações funcionais. Enquanto essa classificação, inclui campos esperados como o design, as artes plásticas, a arquitetura e a literatura, ela permite, também, a inclusão de profissões consideradas tradicionalmente menos criativas, como a arqueologia, assim como áreas altamente técnicas como a programação de softwares e aplicativos. O relatório define, ainda, que o que caracteriza a nova área são três elementos (UNCTAD, 2010): o emprego da criatividade humana, a articulação de mensagens simbólicas, e a potencialidade de geração de propriedade intelectual.},

O objetivo foi avaliar as propriedades físicas do solo de um monocultivo de café situado no município de Castelo (ES), oferecendo subsídios para melhorias da área. Foi escolhida uma pequena propriedade, onde foram coletadas amostras simples de solos para compor a amostragem composta, que foi levada a um laboratório de solos, onde foram feitas análises de: peso específico, análise granulométrica, umidade e densidade aparente. Os experimentos seguiram as Normas Brasileiras Regulamentadas (NBR’s) vigentes. A umidade e o peso específico apresentaram os valores de 17,822\% e 25,442 kN m-3, respectivamente. Apesar de estarem dentro dos padrões, esses parâmetros poderiam apresentar resultados mais satisfatórios. O peso específico apresentou valor intermediário e indicando que não há grande presença de matéria orgânica e óxido de ferro. O solo é bem graduado e a densidade aparente esteve em conformidade com o tipo argiloso, sendo relevante para a cafeicultura. De maneira geral, os valores obtidos estiveram em conformidade com as normas vigentes, porém, o peso específico e a umidade do solo deduzem que há problemas quanto à qualidade do solo, indicando que a mesma não se encontra muito adequada. A adoção de técnicas corretas de manejo agrícola e sistemas agroflorestais são algumas das medidas a serem consideradas para a melhoria dos parâmetros físicos do solo local e de sua produtividade.},

	abstract = {Food systems undergo rapid changes in response to economic and market forces, and environmental and dietary changes. This study aimed to disentangle adaptation strategies in farm households balancing interests in the commercial aspects of farming and the consumption of nutritious foods. The area of interest was Central Myanmar, Pakokku region. A literature-based framework was used to identify entry points for adaptation strategies at the farm household level. A purposive sampling strategy was used to select smallholders (\&lt;5 acres), engaged in market-oriented agriculture (\&ge;10 years). In 14 households, in-depth interviews were conducted, using a life course perspective depicting the household history in relation to agricultural developments and household food and nutrition security. The narratives of smallholders confirmed that household food and nutrition security was grounded in mixed livelihood strategies, including migration. Diet quality depended largely on income. Supportive strategies were a frugal lifestyle, responsible use of resources, participation in community activities, and different forms of social innovation. The study shows how the understanding of local diets provides insights in entry points for nutrition-sensitive agriculture, and suggests a need for alternative adaptation strategies, replacing those promoting specialization and intensification, for more holistic solutions that reinforce the flexibility and resilience of farmers.},

These are a testimony to their experimental efforts. Mostly derived from locally available resources, such solutions are low cost, frugal and easily replicable. These include improved crop varieties, agricultural practices for plant protection and production, or eco-friendly farm practices. This contribution of farmers for coping with environmental stresses and addressing food security problems is now slowly being recognised globally by scientific researchers. It is hoped that formal scientific institutions will try to build upon the coping strategies of creative farmers further, add value and develop innovative products and practices. Such a blending of the best of formal and informal science can only ensure a sustainable future for all by mitigating present and imminent agricultural challenges.},

	abstract = {Agriculture in the Tropical region, which includes Panama and other countries in the Caribbean and Latin America, has been developed using traditional tools with very little technology that has been designed and imported from countries with different environmental conditions. Some studies have suggested that the misuse of these tools may cause a negative impact on food production systems. Therefore, it is important to study, develop, and implement technological solutions that are appropriate for the conditions of specific regions and that help mitigating problems related to climate change and the production of food. One important solution is the implementation of technologies that interact with each other through the use of communication networks in Agriculture, known as “Smart Farming”. Many developed countries have promoted Research and Development (R\&D) in Smart Farming, providing great benefits to their food production sector. The objective of this work is to document and provide an overview of the current situation of the Agriculture in Panama and the opportunities and challenges in the study, development, and implementation of Smart Farming as a technological solution in the agricultural sector in this country, in order to achieve an intelligent agriculture that allows a modern and sustainable food production. Finally, this paper provides some recommendations for the successful implementation of Smart Farming in Panama.},

	abstract = {Abstrato A análise de tecnologia é um processo que utiliza análise textual para detectar tendências na inovação tecnológica. A análise co-word (CWA), um método popular para análise de tecnologia, engloba (1) a definição de um conjunto de palavras-chave ou padrões de frase-chave representados em termos dependentes de tecnologia, (2) a geração de uma rede que codifica as relações entre ocorrências palavras-chave ou frases-chave e (3) identificar tendências específicas da rede. No entanto, a definição do conjunto de padrões de palavras-chave ou frases-chave depende muito do esforço de especialistas, que podem ser caros ou estarem indisponíveis. Além disso, a definição de padrões de palavras-chave ou frases-chave de áreas tecnológicas novas ou emergentes pode ser uma tarefa difícil, mesmo para especialistas. Para resolver a limitação no CWA, esta pesquisa adota uma abordagem baseada na função da propriedade. A propriedade é uma característica específica de um produto, e é geralmente descrito usando adjetivos; a função é uma ação útil de um produto e geralmente é descrita usando verbos. Propriedades e funções representam os conceitos de inovação de um sistema, por isso mostram direções inovadoras em uma determinada tecnologia. A metodologia proposta extrai automaticamente propriedades e funções de patentes usando o processamento de linguagem natural. Usando propriedades e funções como nós e co-ocorrências como links, uma rede de função de propriedade de invenção (IPFN) pode ser gerada. Usando a análise de redes sociais, a metodologia analisa as implicações tecnológicas dos indicadores no IPFN. Portanto, sem a predefinição de padrões de palavras-chave ou frases-chave, a metodologia ajuda os especialistas a se concentrarem mais em seus serviços de conhecimento que identificam as tendências em inovação tecnológica por meio de patentes.},

	abstract = {The wide array of economic activities that sustain income generation creates human pressures that lead to biodiversity and habitat loss, rapid depletion of natural resources, environmental pollution, and climate change, among others. To dissuade the alarming rate of environmental degradation, pro-biodiversity enterprises are promoted and supported in the Philippines. These enterprises conserve biodiversity through the adoption of sustainable use practices and the utilization of biological resources toward equitable sharing of benefits. Organic farming is considered a pro-biodiversity enterprise. It is categorized by the Philippine Department of Agriculture under the Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA). CSA encompasses the application of climate-smart principles in agriculture to enhance the productivity and income, develop resiliency to climate change, and reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. There are a number of grassroots or community-based pro-biodiversity agri-entrepreneurs in the Philippines that complement their farm operations with education tourism activities or farm “edu-tourism” (rural tourism or agri-tourism). It is where tourists including entrepreneurs and technology adopters visit an agricultural farm to engage in learning experiences, meet with farmers, and understand their culture as well as practices in food production and marketing. CSA edu-tourism provides income to farmers from the sales of farm produce and demonstration of farm activities. The study defines the value-added features of CSA edu-tourism to planning, implementing, and managing community-based pro-biodiversity enterprises in the Philippines. The in-depth interview with organic farmers and entrepreneurs provided the multifarious benefits of CSA edu-tourism and emphasized how it promotes harmonization of communities with nature. The study also demonstrated the relationship between edu-tourism and grassroots pro-biodiversity entrepreneurship considering the environmental conservation approach of CSA. Further, the study determined the potential financial and cultural gains of pro-biodiversity entrepreneurs from CSA edu-tourism as basis in planning sustainable, climate-sensitive, and biodiversity-friendly grassroots enterprises.},

	abstract = {In 1996, the pharmaceutical products and processes became patentable once again in Brazil, as imposed by the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, even though the Brazilian Patent Office or INPI, as known in Brazil, still lacked the qualified personnel. Methodologically, we define patents as an indirect stimulus to innovation based on a contract between the patentee and society, where the former receives exclusivity in the commercial exploration in exchange for the public and sufficient disclosure of knowledge. The goal of this paper is to do an ex-post analysis of the prosecution of 293 granted pharmaceutical patents and test the hypothesis that the system potentially favors the patentee in detriment of society, due to the expansion of the term of patent. After the investigation of patentees, deadlines, prosecution, and documents, the results show, on one hand, a significant delay in the prosecution of these applications by the INPI, missing its deadlines, and, on the other hand, the patentees’ strategy to use almost entirely the time they have. Therefore, the combination of the patent prosecution and some legal provisions such as the minimum of term of patent tips the balance between patentee and society, in favor of the former.},

Para isso, foram analisadas amostras de solo quanto à textura e aos atributos químicos e realizado um levantamento fitossociológico da região. Na análise de componentes principais, as relações do complexo solo foram resumidas em quatro componentes que juntos explicaram 80\% da variância dos dados, com relações mais significativas entre a soma de bases, saturação por bases, capacidade de troca catiônica efetiva, saturação por alumínio, Ca+Mg, Al e argila, com coeficiente de correlação maior que 90\%. Na análise de agrupamento hierárquico, com 70\% de similaridade quanto aos atributos do solo, formaram-se três grupos distintos de espécies florestais. A análise multivariada foi eficiente na redução das variáveis originais, separação e classificação dos grupos e identificação dos atributos químicos do solo mais requeridos pelas espécies florestais. Os Grupos 1 e 2 contêm espécies mais exigentes em fertilidade, com preferências por solos de textura média ricos em bases de cálcio e magnésio, enquanto o Grupo 3 parece ser menos exigente, prevalecendo em solos mais arenosos e mais ácidos, com grande capacidade de troca de cátions e elevada saturação por alumínio; podendo, as espécies desse último grupo, ser indicadas para recuperação de áreas degradadas. As espécies Copaifera sp. e Goupia glabra merecem mais estudos quanto aos mecanismos de adaptação às condições de baixa fertilidade do solo.},

The erosion quantification by means of modeling is essential for understanding and controlling the process. In this context, this paper aimed to estimate soil loss by erosion in Perobas stream watershed, located in Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo, São Paulo state, using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), in 1962 and 2011, periods characterized by distinct land uses and management. The total soil losses were 49,130.37 ton in 1962 and 53,201.41 ton in 2011. Despite the implementation of support practices in 2011, which made the mean P factor to decrease from 0.786 to 0.466, and the improvement of crop management, there was a reduction in soil coverage by native forests and “campestre” formation (shrubs and sparse forest), with the consequent expansion of farming and livestock areas, the replacement of coffee crops by soybean and the increase of sugarcane and corn croplands. The Natural Potential of Erosion had a moderate correlation with the estimated erosion rates. The simulated erosion risk showed soil loss below tolerance, which ranges from 3.08 to 15.94 t.ha-1.yr-1 according to the soil type, in 74.09\% and 75.14\% of the study site in 1962 and 2011, respectively.},

The present work is a spatial analysis of the perturbation factors and their potential environmental impacts on the water resources identified in the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) – Botucatu-SP Perimeter this portion located within the municipality of São Manuel, State of São Paulo , through digital images of Google Earth Pro since the years of 2010 to 2016. It was identified eight areas with perturbation factors (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) , where it was possible to detect points of deforestation and the pasture and monoculture crops increase in areas of environmental preservation, such as springs and places of potential aquifer recharge. These irregular occupations generate impacts on water production, such as soil sealing, runoff and erosion with sediment transport. This procedure is applicable to municipalities of small and medium size to detect and monitor environmental nonconformities.},

	url = {http://www.profigen.com.br},
	abstract = {An apple that is soft and lacks juiciness during consumption is characterized as a mealy fruit. Since mealiness in apple is considered as an undesirable quality parameter, this work aimed at developing classification models based on biospeckle imaging in order to recognize mealy from non-mealy apples. To evaluate the potential of biospeckle imaging in detection of mealiness, a total of 760 'Red Delicious' apples were harvested. The 540 samples were stored under cold conditions for various time periods from 0 to 5 months. The remaining samples were kept at 20°C and 95\{\%\} relative humidity for 10-26 days. Biospeckle images of each apple were acquired at wavelengths of 680 and 780nm, respectively. Biospeckle imaging was immediately followed by a confined compression test to measure fruit stiffness and juiciness. These parameters were used to categorize the samples into three classes called fresh, semi-mealy, and mealy. Results of clustering based on a self-organizing map showed that apple fruit are mealy when their stiffness and juiciness are less than 20kNm-1 and 5cm2, respectively. After classification of apples by destructive methods, time-historical speckle patterns were configured and biospeckle features such as the inertia moment, the absolute value of differences, and autocorrelation were extracted. Results showed that biospeckle activity for fresh samples was higher than semi-mealy and mealy. Finally, several neural network models were developed to classify apples. First, classification of apples into mealy and non-mealy classes was carried out, and then non-mealy apples were classified into fresh and semi-mealy classes. The best classification accuracy for fresh (81.7\{\%\}) and semi-mealy (70.9\{\%\}) apples were achieved at 780nm. However, much better result (77.3\{\%\} accuracy) for classification of mealy apples was observed at the wavelength of 680nm.},

	abstract = {Diffuse reflection of laser radiation by a biological tissue always gives rise to the formation of a biospeckle pattern. The biospeckle pattern depends on the surface irregularities and carries significant information about the surface roughness. Biospeckle imaging has been extensively applied to medicine, biology and agriculture for evaluating different types of biological tissues, since it is safe, simple and non-destructive optical method. In consequence of the texture properties of biospeckle pattern, various texture analysis methods have been presented in literature for extracting the information involved in biospeckle patterns. In this work, first, an experimental setup to simultaneously capture multiple biospeckle patterns from many cross-section areas of bovine articular cartilage tissue surface is investigated. Next, a new model based on local contrast measurement is proposed on the captured biospeckle patterns for final and proper estimation of the average roughness of the various cross-section areas of articular cartilage surface. The proposed model computes the local contrast for pairs of pixels at different neighborhood separation distances in order to obtain three contrast features. The obtained results showed that the contrast features can efficiently differentiate between the average roughness of the different cross-section areas of articular cartilage surface with 0.02 μm accuracy.},

O objetivo desse trabalho foi apresentar uma análise multitemporal dos processos erosivos no baixo curso do rio São Francisco, à jusante da UHE Xingo. Foram realizados estudos do comportamento dos taludes marginais a partir da instrumentação em seções localizadas no Perímetro Irrigado Cotinguiba Pindoba, localizado no município de Própria, Estado de Sergipe, assim como caracterização da erosão na margem do rio até a sua foz. Os métodos de investigação utilizados foram levantamentos e observações diretas no  campo, e análise dos dados hidrológicos e sedimentológicos primários. A variação das taxas de erosão ocorreu em função da localização das seções monitoradas, da composição granulométrica do solo dos taludes, da altura, da ação dos ventos, da velocidade do fluxo próximo à margem e do fluxo hidráulico nos taludes, direcionado do solo para o rio. A análise das causas imediatas e dos fatores intervenientes na erosão marginal revelou que o recuo das margens é o resultado de um fenômeno complexo, que envolve processos diretamente relacionados à dinâmica do canal e ao comportamento geotécnico da margem fluvial. O recuo também está relacionado às oscilações artificiais promovidas pela operação das barragens a montante de Xingó, que estabeleceram um novo regime hidrosedimentológico e induziram um novo comportamento morfodinâmico para o rio.},

No primeiro sistema de produção comumente utilizado pelos produtores, utilizou-se solo sem cobertura vegetal, fertirrigado e com camalhões e, no segundo sistema, utilizaram-se subsolagem, plantio em sulcos com coberturas vegetais e irrigação. O camalhão isola as raízes do excesso de água e dos fungos do solo; no entanto, ele demanda muitas práticas mecânicas, compacta o solo e degrada a área, o que resulta na necessidade de pousio e, eventualmente, de migração da cultura. As raízes amostradas foram separadas do solo por peneiramento em água e, em seguida, escaneadas, e seu comprimento e diâmetro foram medidos. Os tratamentos T1 (vegetação espontânea), T2 (leguminosa), T3 (gramínea) e T4 (leguminosa mais gramínea), sem o uso de camalhões e irrigados, apresentam menor densidade de raiz e produtividade de frutos do que o T5 (testemunha) cultivado sem uso de cobertura vegetal, com camalhão e fertirrigação. A fertirrigação aumenta a densidade de raízes, mas as concentra abaixo dos gotejadores. As coberturas vegetais superam a vegetação espontânea em densidade de raiz, mas a igualam em produtividade.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the root development of the physical condition and the potential of agricultural use of a constructed minesoil after coal mining, besides the root development of tropical grasses in this soil, considering different revegetation periods. The soil was constructed in early 2003, and the experiment was installed in November/December 2007. Soil physical condition was evaluated in plots vegetated with perennial grasses such as Urochloa humidicola, Panicum maximum, and U. brizantha. In July 2012, disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken for determining physical and chemical attributes in the 0.00–0.10, 0.10–0.20, and 0.20–0.30-m soil layers. Soil monoliths were collected for characterizing the root system. After 58 months of revegetation, the physical condition of the constructed minesoil is still inadequate to an agricultural use that requires intensive soil management. Among the evaluated layers, only the 0.00–0.10m layer provides conditions for the soil to function properly in the ecosystem. Urochloa brizantha was more promising for the recovery of soil structure in the 0.00–0.10-m soil layer, and root density was the most sensitive attribute to distinguish the potential development of the different species in this layer.},

Cinco pastagens sobre Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo foram selecionadas, em terço médio da encosta, com diferentes níveis visuais de degradação, tendo-se considerado as variáveis: perda de vigor, presença de espécies espontâneas, solo exposto e erosão. Avaliou-se a cobertura do solo, e coletaram-se amostras nas profundidades de 0,00-0,05, 0,05-0,10 e 0,10-0,20 m, para as análises físicas, químicas e de matéria orgânica. Diferentemente da classificação visual, a análise de agrupamento das variáveis de cobertura indicou apenas dois níveis de degradação: de baixo a moderado e de alto a muito alto, com percentual de classificações corretas acima de 87\% na análise discriminante, em que o solo exposto foi a variável mais assertiva para discriminar os níveis de degradação. A matéria orgânica leve e o componente Ca+Mg foram os indicadores de qualidade mais relacionados aos índices de degradação de pastagens à profundidade de 0,00-0,05 m; enquanto o teor de potássio foi o indicador mais relacionado aos índices às profundidades de 0,05-0,10 e 0,10-0,20 m.Termos para indexação: Urochloa; cobertura de solo; degradação do solo; matéria orgânica leve},

A atividade geoturística, pode ser uma forma de conservação do ambiente natural. Porém, a utilização de trilhas geoturísticas pode acarretar impactos quando não há planejamento e manejo adequados para sua implementação e utilização. A pesquisa teve como objetivo analisar o impacto da utilização de duas trilhas localizadas no litoral do Parque Nacional da Serra da Bocaina (PNSB), município de Paraty (RJ). Para isso, foram analisados quatro pontos em duas trilhas no PNSB, sendo realizados monitoramento da microtopografia do solo através do método de pontes de erosão e a avaliação da compactação através da penetrometria. Além disso, foram observados alguns impactos visuais ao longo das trilhas.  Constatou-se que o leito da trilha está sofrendo com o efeito do pisoteio, principalmente em P2 onde a resistência à penetração foi de 29,07 kgf/cm², e com a remoção de sedimentos pela erosão hídrica, principalmente em PE 1, onde a área erodida foi de aproximadamente 0,37m². Há necessidade de readequar o traçado em alguns pontos das trilhas (como em PE 4, onde já existe um atalho criado pelos visitantes), bem como, incorporar matéria orgânica e revegetar as bordas trilha, principalmente no talude superior de PE 2 onde ocorreu movimento de massa.},

	abstract = {O cultivo do tabaco na região Sudeste do Estado do Paraná é realizado em pequenas propriedades absorvendo grande parte da mão-de-obra familiar. As áreas de cultivo, geralmente indicam restrições ao uso, por apresentarem solos rasos e declividade superior a 20\%, o que potencializa a utilização do plantio convencional com a utilização da tração animal para a realização das atividades. De forma insipiente, vem-se adotando o plantio direto nas áreas que permitem o uso de implementos agrícolas. No plantio convencional o solo fica exposto sendo revolvido constantemente desde o plantio do tabaco (setembro) até o início da colheita (dezembro). Já no plantio direto há uma redução das atividades de revolvimento do solo devido à camada morta. A variação das atividades pode promover respostas hidrológicas e geomorfológicas diferentes nas duas formas de cultivo. Para identificar tais variações este trabalho se propôs a avaliar a exposição do solo, compactação, infiltração perda de água e solo nos dois tipos de cultivo ao longo da safra de 2009/2010. Foram identificadas duas áreas em uma mesma vertente com diferentes formas de cultivo. O monitoramento teve inicio no mês de setembro (plantio) a março (término da colheita). Ao término da pesquisa observou-se que a infiltração média de água no solo no plantio direto foi 20,9\% superior ao plantio convencional e J a compactação do solo foi 78,4\% superior no plantio convencional. Já a perda de água no plantio direto foi 3 vezes inferior e a perda de solo foi 6 vezes maior no plantio convencional.},

Anaerobic treatment is widely applied as a biological treatment step for domestic wastewater. The high efficiency of degradation of organic matter in this type of process and the lower production of residual sludge are some of the main advantages that have promoted the increasing use of this process. The general objective of the present work is the identification of the technologies used for the anaerobic treatment of sludge with focus on energy production. For that, bibliometric and patentometric techniques are used, using as tools VOSviewer® and Questel Orbit® software. After analyzing the maps and graphs generated, it is concluded that it is efficient to make a recent exploratory study of the scientific and technological evolution on biogas, directing new studies and production of new patents, involving, for example, the following IPC codes C12M-001/107, C12P-005/02 and C12M-001/02.},

Methods: Was used the Thinking Design methodology divided into four phases: Discovery, Definition, Development and Delivery. Discovery Phase: Desk research was carried out in: SciELO, Pubmed, LILACS, Google and Google Scholar. Once the target audience was selected, the interviews were conducted. Definition Phase: the interviewees’ difficulties were mapped, on an Excel spreadsheet. Development Phase: a brainstorming was conducted with the public interviewed. Delivery Phase: the prototype, validation and final elaboration of the tool were made.
Results: Discovery Phase: 10 inventors were identified and the interviews were carried out. Definition Phase: 80\% of the interviewees determined lack of information as one of the problems. The main content was defined as: the patent process, from the beginning of the idea to the deposit (70\%), search for precedence (40\%) and informing partners (30\%). Development Phase: with the brainstorming, the tool type was defined as an interactive site. Delivery Phase: a prototype with content framework and an interactive video was presented for validation. After approval, the interactive website was developed, which was made available to the public.
Conclusion: A question and answer tool on patents in EMHO was developed.},

Esses princípios se aplicam a todos aqueles que procuram construir produtos verdadeiramente novos sem desperdício, que podem ser utilizados tanto por startups de empresas de garagem quanto por inovadores presentes nas grandes empresas. Ries, que é empreendedor residente na Harvard Business School, também define desperdício como "toda atividade que não contribui para se aprender a respeito dos clientes". Trazendo histórias da vida real e lições aprendidas de algumas das empresas mais dinâmicas da atualidade, o autor descreve um plano para que cada um possa executar os princípios fundamentais da startup enxuta em qualquer projeto.},

One reason for this is that improved front-end decisions greatly aﬀect company performance. To ﬁnd the answers to this question, this review article analyzes scientiﬁc publications on innovation indicators published between 1980 and 2015. The objective of this article is to increase the understanding of the indicator landscape and to complement the various stages of the innovation process with relevant indicators. In doing so, this study categorizes the identiﬁed indicators into companyspeciﬁc and contextual dimensions. Furthermore, this study analyzes the indicators in terms of their potential for ex-ante and ex-post evaluation and investigates the characteristics of relevant publications. The analysis ﬁnds that more process rather than product indicators exist in the literature. Current publications emphasize qualitative and indirect indicators but neglect indicators for the early stages of the innovation process. The review identiﬁes 82 unique indicators to evaluate innovations including 26 indicators for the early stages. The results can help managers, researchers, and policymakers to better understand the innovation process and the indicator landscape. However, more concrete indicators are needed to improve front-end innovation decisions.},

Thus, the demand for trained professionals to work in dairy properties is a growing reality in the State of Espírito Santo, Brazil, given the trends in the international market, improvement of productivity and quality of the products offered.

Therefore, the objective of this article is to ﬁll this gap in the regional labor market because, ideologically, we know that few professionals are aware of the need to produce with efﬁciency and low environmental impact. That is, the learning resources that have to be mobilized in order to build a professional that is not only theoretical / practical, but also aware of the demands of the consumer market, human needs and quality of the product offered.},

With innovation associated with contexts of uncertainties and transformations, the development of dynamic capacities by companies seeking to innovate becomes fundamental in the search for competitive differentials. In this context, this article aims to understand the relationships between the multiple dimensions of innovation and the dynamic capacities in MPEs of the segment of fitness academies in the city of Natal/RN. To understand this relationship, this research had as a theoretical framework the models of the dynamic capabilities of detection, capture and reconfiguration as well as the Radar of Innovation. The study consists of a qualitative research, of a descriptive character, developed with 15 academies active in the city of Natal/RN. As a result of the research, it was possible to note that the multiple innovations developed, in cycles 0 and 1 of the ALI program, by the studied academies, reflect in the development of the dynamic capacities of detection, capture and reconfiguration, as observed in the results of empirical research. It was also possible to observe that the variability in the degrees of the multiple dimensions of innovation in the research organizations are the result of the influence of the dynamism of the environment on the resources, skills, competences and organizational knowledge, being one of the criteria for distinction between organizations and training competitive advantages. Conclusively, it was possible to identify the theoretical adherence between the models of the Radar of Innovation and dynamic capacities, which allows this study to contribute in the discussions on innovation and training of dynamic capacities.},

Thus, the Patent2net was used to identify, mine, organize and make available in the format of graphical interfaces and dynamic tables technological information described in dengue patents deposited in Espacenet database. The results obtained allowed to identify patents with frugality potential, inclusive and with a low cost of replication, and whose protection did not extend to Brazil, allowing its free reproduction in national territory.

	abstract = {Aware of the challenges of today's society, the Portucalense University (UPT) has implemented a curricular unit (UC), called "Entrepreneurship", transversal to all curricula of the first cycle courses of its training offer. This UC, placed in the 3rd year of undergraduate courses, is based on a project-based learning methodology, which takes place over a period of 1 semester, in a total of 17 sessions, which can take different pedagogical formats: lectures, mentoring, seminars and pitchs. The students, from different study programmes of UPT undergraduate degrees, make teams of four students (maximum). Each team aims to develop an innovative business idea that demonstrates economic and financial viability. This study seeks to analyse students’ perceptions about the curricular unit of Entrepreneurship. To do this, in the 2016/2017 academic year, a questionnaire was applied to the students (N = 131). The questionnaire included a set of 40 questions, structured according to the Likert scale model, resulting from an existing conceptual framework in the field of PBL and evaluation practices already developed in the context of Higher Education. The questionnaire covers topics such as learning and skills developed by the students, teamwork, the role of the teacher, the evaluation process of the students and, in general, the evaluation of the project as a teaching and learning methodology. The questionnaire also includes a final question about the compulsory or optional nature of this curricular unit. The results are discussed, exploring the pedagogical implications for Higher Education intervention, suggesting the need for a greater reflection and discussion about the relevance and the nature of the projects for each one of the different areas of specialization of the students, the support given by the teachers during the development of the project, the structure and organization of the semester, as well as the assessment moments and elements of the UC of Entrepreneurship.},

Biospeckle at 635 nm, 690 nm and 830. nm, and backscattering at 690 nm, 830 nm and 1060 nm showed a high potential for determining changes during storage of intact fruit, while chlorophyll fluorescence, VIS/NIR spectroscopy and backscattering measured at 830. nm, and 1060 nm were appropriate to detect changes in fruit subjected to high hydrostatic pressures. Spectral measurements of apples treated with 150 and 200 MPa showed mainly textural changes and, during post-pressure storage, changes in chemical composition. Decrease in physiological activity and increased rates of enzymatic processes in pressure-treated apples may be responsible for the inability of biospeckle to detect pressure-induced changes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Biospeckle laser technique has become an important tool to investigate biological activity in several areas of science. However, due to the complexity of biological materials it is necessary to develop research processes that ensure greater efficiency in isolating areas of different activities in the same material using the biospeckle. Thus, alternative techniques, such as those related to spectral domain, allow approaches that provide a means for frequency and isolation marking of various observed phenomena. The possibility of creating frequency markers related to physical or chemical phenomena under biospeckle laser monitoring opens the way for important applications in the analysis of biological materials. In seeds, for example, one research challenge is the creation of a methodology to analyze their vigor undermining the influence of water activity. This study aimed to use wavelet transform to create maps in frequency of biological material, particularly from maize and bean seeds, seeking to isolate water activity. Wavelet transform was used in conjunction with traditional biospeckle laser methods, Fujii, Generalized Differences and Time History Speckle Patterns. The data analysis allowed access of information in different frequencies, making it possible to map activities that only occur at certain frequencies in the seeds associated to particular areas they operate, as in the case of activities present in the embryo as well as those present in the endosperm. Thus the work enabled the identification of frequency bands where water activity may be operating creating a signature useful in further works.},

	doi = {10.3390/s16050661},
	abstract = {Determination of the optimum harvest window plays a key role in the agro-food chain as the quality of fruit depends on the right harvesting time and appropriate storage conditions during the postharvest period. Usually, indices based on destructive measurements are used for this purpose, like the De Jager Index (PFW-1), FARS index and the most popular Streif Index. In this study, we proposed a biospeckle method for the evaluation of the optimum harvest window (OHW) of the “Ligol” and “Szampion” apple cultivars. The experiment involved eight different maturity stages, of which four were followed by long cold storage and shelf life to assist the determination of the optimum harvest window. The biospeckle activity was studied in relation to standard quality attributes (firmness, acidity, starch, soluble solids content, Streif Index) and physiological parameters (respiration and ethylene emission) of both apple cultivars. Changes of biospeckle activity (BA) over time showed moderate relationships with biochemical changes during apple maturation and ripening. The harvest date suggested by the Streif Index and postharvest quality indicators matched with characteristic decrease in BA. The ability of biospeckle method to characterize the biological state of apples was confirmed by significant correlations of BA with firmness, starch index, total soluble solids and Streif Index, as well as good match with changes in carbon dioxide and ethylene emission. However, it should be noted that correlations between variables changing over time are not as meaningful as independent observations. Also, it is a well-known property of the Pearson’s correlation that its value is highly susceptible to outlier data. Due to its non-selective nature the BA reflected only the current biological state of the fruit and could be affected by many other factors. The investigations showed that the optimum harvest window for apples was indicated by the characteristic drop of BA during pre-harvest development. Despite this, at the current state of development the BA method cannot be used as an indicator alone. Due to rather poor results for prediction in OHW the BA measurements should be supported by other destructive methods to compensate its low selectivity.},

There are different approaches to monitor maturation and they can be classified as destructive and non-destructive. Variables obtained by optical instruments have been used to determine maturation stage. The present study evaluated the relationship between the biological activity measured by the optical technique of biospeckle laser and firmness, measured in the Acrocomia aculeata fruit pulp between the 41st and 61st week after flowering. The biological activity was quantified by biospeckle images, while the fruit pulp firmness was determined by digital penetrometer. Correlations between variables were evaluated during maturation and in the senescence of fruits. According to the results, significant correlation between biological activity and firmness was found for both evaluated conditions, demonstrating that biospeckle laser can be an effective non-invasive indicator of Acrocomia aculeate fruit maturation assisting in the determination of the moment of harvest.},

It has been applied to medicine, agriculture and microbiology for monitoring processes related to the movement of material particles. Recently, this method is extensively used for evaluation of quality of agricultural crops. In the case of botanical materials, the sources of apparent biospeckle activity are the Brownian motions and biological processes such as cyclosis, growth, transport, etc. Several different applications have been shown to monitor aging and maturation of samples, organ development and the detection and development of defects and diseases. This review will focus on three aspects: on the image analysis and mathematical methods for biospeckle activity evaluation, on published applications to botanical samples, with special attention to agricultural crops, and on interpretation of the phenomena from a biological point of view. \{\{\}\{©\}\{\}\} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Seeds age during storage, resulting in a decline in germination and seedling quality. Seed quality tests are important to monitor this decline. However, such tests are usually destructive and require large seed numbers and long time. For coffee seeds the standard germination test and assessment of seedling quality takes 30 days. Biospeckle has been used previously as a non-destructive optical tool to monitor biological activity in a range of tissues. Biospeckle was applied 3–6 days after imbibition (DAI) to investigate an association with coffee seedling quality after 30 days. Two distinct areas of biospeckle activity were demonstrated, concurring with the locations of the embryonic axis and the cotyledons in the apical and central seed parts, respectively. Moisture content analysis revealed that embryos of imbibed seeds contained more water than endosperm. Different areas within the endosperm did not differ in moisture content, while the moisture content of the axis was higher than that of the cotyledons, and this did not change from 4 DAI. Therefore, it was concluded that high biospeckle activity was not the result of increased water content in any seed part, but more likely of growth and metabolism in the axis and cotyledons, which had been described previously. A threshold biospeckle ratio apical : central of 1.02 after 6 days distinguished between seeds that produced dead and viable seedlings after 30 days and provided similar results as a tetrazolium test, a widely acknowledged but destructive test for seed quality. Thus, biospeckle data provided a non-destructive early parameter for seedling quality, based on embryo growth during germination.},

Foram avaliados o crescimento micelial, produção e germinação de conídios de B. cinerea, com a incorporação do óleo no meio de cultura. Realizou-se ainda uma avaliação de voláteis e a eficiência de óleos em isolado resistente a fungicida. Para cada teste, diferentes óleos apresentaram eficiência, contudo capim limão, palmarosa, canela e menta demonstraram os melhores efeitos em todos os testes realizados. Todos os tratamentos a base de óleos demonstraram efeito semelhante a um fungicida recomendado para a cultura, a base de tiofanato metílico. Dois tratamentos mostraram-se efetivos no caso de isolado resistente (óleo de capim limão e de canela). Óleos essenciais mostram-se como opção promissora para o desenvolvimento de possíveis produtos fitossanitários para o manejo de doenças em plantas. Palavras-Chave: Fragaria x ananassa Duch. Ex.

	abstract = {The control of soil erosion along the banks of the São Francisco River requires the use of effcient and economically viable strategies. Soil bioengineering techniques may be an alternative to the conventional methods as they provide good soil stabilization by mechanical reinforcement promoted by the roots. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of the root cohesion of vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty) on slope stabilization in erosion control along the right margin of the São Francisco river. Seedlings of vetiver grass were planted in the riverbank of the Lower São Francisco located in Sergipe State, northeast Brazil, and plants were sampled after two years of growth to evaluate the effect of grass on the shear strength of the soil. The monolith and cylinder method was used to collect roots for the evaluation of Root Density (RL), Root Length Density (RLD), Root Area Ratio (RAR), Root Tensile Strength (TR), and Root Cohesion (CR). Data were submitted to analysis of variance (p {\textless} 0.05), with polynomial regression analysis. The results show that for RL, RLD, and RAR, the layers of soil at depths of 0-0.10 m had the highest values of 4.84 kg m -3},

Além da disposição dos atores em empreender e tornar o processo de agroindustrialização uma realidade socioeconômica que dinamiza o desenvolvimento local, há diversas interações com o ambiente institucional favorável a estas iniciativas. Baseado em 19 estudos de casos com empreendimentos rurais familiares de três regiões no Estado do RS, o objetivo deste artigo foi o de demonstrar a capacidade de implementar processos de interações sociais e institucionais visando à inovação. Estas interações foram caracterizadas a partir de evidências empíricas de relacionamentos com organizações, entidades e instituições. As interações foram caracterizadas a partir dos mecanismos (como?) e das finalidades (por quê?) pelas quais ocorreram o relacionamento. Além disso, três atributos foram analisados na interação: busca de fontes abertas de informação, aquisição de conhecimento ou tecnologia e/ou inovação cooperativa. O resultado, a partir da análise de agrupamento, evidenciou 13 categorias de interações para a implementação de processos de inovação no âmbito das agroindústrias familiares, destacando-se como uma prática evidentemente importante para o desenvolvimento local destes empreendimentos rurais.},

It was observed a total of deposited documents between 1 and 4 per year, during the period 1912-2000. In 2001, was found a greater number of patent applications (9). The Great Britain stood out as the largest holder of patents relating to cocoa and cocoa products (40). It was noted that 98.39\% of patent documents in Espacenet were directed mainly to the food industry sector and only 1.61\% were intended for the pharmaceutical industry.

Design / methodology / approach: This work is of an applied nature, is a unique case study with exploratory objectives, of the unit case called GatoXadrez.com that will act in the area of education with themes of entrepreneurship, ethics, fiscal citizenship and accounting. With qualitative approach, for to analyze non quantifiable aspects and quantitative aiming for greater precision of the results. Data collection was done through: data collection by secondary and direct sources, direct observation and application of 270 questionnaires. Data analysis was performed through: content analysis, multivariate, descriptive and documentary analysis. 
Results: The results showed that the use of the lean startup model allowed the creation of the new company and its first MVP, favoring the process of validation of the premises and confirming its viability. The union of the lean startup model with the concepts of open innovation were also viable, as it gathered the professionals needed to develop the first product and develop the business. 
Practical implications: New entrepreneurs will be able to use these concepts to create companies with the minimum of financial resources, without the use of traditional business plans, using besides accounting control and gradual implementation of management controls, the accounting for innovation, which results in opportunities for success. This combination also suggests a new way of teaching entrepreneurship concepts to children from collaboration. Originality and contributions: The lean startup model propose a new way of thinking and building products and services and the concepts of open innovation can meet the demands of the new business. The work seeks to contribute to the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, with a new way of undertaking. The unit case is also relevant when seeking to teach children in a playful way, preparing them for the future, concepts of entrepreneurship, accounting, ethics and fiscal citizenship.},

	abstract = {Soil compaction constitutes a major threat to the fertility of arable soils and food security. The aim of this paper is to highlight the need and opportunities for plant eco-physiological approaches to identify strategies to recover crop yields after soil compaction. Reduced productivity on compacted soil primarily results from decreased root elongation rates and thus limited accessibility to water and nutrients. Hence, strategies to recover productivity after compaction must address plant eco-physiological phenomena that underlie low root system expansion rates. In compacted soil, root growth is decreased due to high soil penetration resistance and due to low oxygen concentration in soil air caused by reduced ﬂuid transport capability. Thus, plant roots are exposed to a multistress environment, which needs to be addressed directly when aiming to recover productivity after compaction in the long-term. Here, we discuss possibilities to increase root growth in order to enhance resource accessibility and recover crop productivity on compacted soil. Yield recovery can be achieved through breeding of novel cultivars and targeted soil management approaches. On the one hand, the tolerance of plants to the diﬀerent soil physical stresses can be enhanced by selecting for speciﬁc root traits that facilitate root growth in compacted soil. Soil management approaches that improve speciﬁc physical properties of compacted soil on the other hand can facilitate root growth in compacted soil. Since plant roots are major drivers of soil structure dynamics, increasing root growth in compacted soil may not only mitigate crop productivity losses but also recover soil structure.},

	abstract = {The mechanisation of forestry operations is too recent in France to have enough perspective and scientiﬁc knowledge of the eﬀects on extensively managed soils. Two experimental sites on soils sensitive to compaction (silty acidic soils laying on top of a clayey subsoil) were set in Lorraine (France). A gentle and controlled compaction of these physically very analogous soils was carried out during spring 2007 at the Azerailles site (AZ) and during spring 2008 at the Clermont-en-Argonne site (CA). Immediate changes were observed for all ecosystem physical, chemical and biological functioning indicators. Soil restoration dynamics were followed using continuous monitoring of numerous parameters, including soil moisture and occurrence of a perched water table (PWT) (monitored at a daily time step) and PWT chemistry (monthly time step). Mid-term monitoring (7–8 years) results showed that both soils shifted towards a hydromorphic soil type attested by the increase in PWT frequency and duration, which invaded the soil upper layers, leading to characteristic Fe, Mn and S mobility and a change in organic compounds stability. Though soil types were very similar, the PWT characteristics varied notably between both sites. The mean residence time of the PWT was shown to be a major driver of its geochemistry, but with strong interaction with soil characteristics. A previous study made on both sites suggested that soil clay content and clay mineralogy controls the PWT dynamics through eﬀects on aggregation. From a PWT perspective, seven years of monitoring were insuﬃcient to observe any soil compaction recovery in the richer soil of AZ but a partial recovery was observed for the chemically poorer soil (CA). Compaction durably impacted the two studied soils and the probability that a new compaction event may occur before the complete recovery from the ﬁrst disturbance must be considered in forest management.},

When screens of same mesh density are superposed, fringes are generated which move when its relative positions are displaced (Sciammarella, 1982). Lord Rayleigh, 1874 (Oster et al, 1964) proposed the application of a moiré technique in testing diffraction grids. Mulot (1925) applied that technique in studying deformations of mica layers. Later on, Tollenar (1945) reported that moiré fringes can be used to magnify displacements, being also suitable as a photoelastic method. Recent reports present comprehensive classifications of the methods termed as moiré. Albiero et al (2003) reported the preceding research work, in which a divergent light beam, a less precise angle and distance data measurement and a slightly discontinuous sinusoidal grid have been employed, generating noise and image distortion. By improving the geometrical measurements, a highly continuous sinusoidal grid as well as a collimated light beam and a higher resolution CCD camera, the superposition of image discontinuities during the unwrapping procedure of the Phase Shifting method, as well as noise occurrence were satisfactorily avoided, improving the image processing.},

Os atributos físicos do solo foram avaliados nas camadas de 0,0–0,1, 0,1–0,2 e 0,2–0,3 m de profundidade, na linha de plantio, no local em que o rodado passa e no entrerrodado. Avaliaram-se também os efeitos desses tratamentos sobre a produtividade da cana-de-açucar, respectivamente. O tráfego das máquinas agrícolas aumenta a densidade do solo e diminui o diâmetro médio ponderado dos agregados e a macroporosidade na linha de rodado em relação à linha de plantio, o que causa a degradação cumulativa da qualidade física do solo, ao longo dos anos de cultivo. Os dois anos de controle de tráfego agrícola da colheita não influenciaram os atributos físicos do solo estudados.},

	abstract = {O processo de mecanização da colheita de madeira possibilitou um aumento significativo na produtividade e na qualidade das operações. Entretanto, o tráfego intenso de máquinas pesadas tem sido o grande responsável pela compactação do solo em áreas florestais. Este trabalho teve como principal objetivo avaliar os níveis de compactação de um Latossolo causada pelo trator florestal skidder com rodados de pneus e rodados de pneus recobertos com semiesteiras. O estudo foi conduzido nas áreas de colheita de madeira de uma empresa florestal localizada no estado do Paraná. A compactação do solo foi determinada por meio de alterações nas variáveis de densidade, porosidade total, porosidade de aeração e resistência do solo à penetração. As amostras de solo e os dados de resistência à penetração foram coletados em quatro pontos igualmente espaçados ao longo das trilhas de tráfego das máquinas e em linhas sem tráfego (testemunha), em três níveis de profundidade (0 a 15, 15 a 30 e 30 a 50 cm). A análise dos resultados mostrou que o skidder equipado com rodados de pneus foi responsável pela maior alteração na densidade do solo, com 1,22 e 1,17 mg.m-3 nas profundidade de 0 a 15 e 15 a 30 cm, respectivamente. Não houve alteração significativa nas propriedades físicas do solo devido ao tráfego do skidder com os diferentes tipos de rodados, mostrando que a instalação da semiesteira nos rodados das máquinas não acarretou em redução da compactação do solo.Palavras-chave: Compactação; tipos de rodados; extração florestal. AbstractCompaction of a latosol subjected to skidder traffic with different wheeled. The process of mechanization of timber harvesting allowed a significant increase in productivity and quality of operations. However, heavy traffic of large machines has been largely responsible for soil compaction in forest areas.This research aimed to evaluate the latosol compaction caused by skidder with tires and tracks over the tires. The study was developed in the logging areas of a forestry company located in Parana State. Soil compaction was evaluated by soil bulk density, aeration porosity, total porosity and penetrometer resistance. The soil samples and date of penetrometer resistance were taken at four points equally spaced along both the trails with and without traffic at three depth levels (0 to 15, 15 to 30 and 30 to 50 cm). The results showed that the skidder equipped with tires was responsible for the greatest change in density, with 1.22 and 1.17 mg.m-3 in the depth of 0 to 15 and 15 to 30 cm, respectively. There was not significant change in soil physical properties caused by skidder traffic with the different wheeled types, proving that the installation of the tracks over tires did not result in smaller soil compaction.Keywords: Compaction; wheeled types; wood extraction.},

Tests were also made with a power take-off dynamometer. The results of a three years research project were used to establish a mathematical model to estimate the draught requirement of the disc harrows, valid for dry, undisturbed loam soils, and to validate the linear relationship between the drawbar pull per unit of implement width and the fuel consumption per hectare, which indicates the tractorimplement dimensioning.

	abstract = {Liming is a well-established practice to ameliorate acidic soils worldwide. However, the role of liming in soil structure formation and its relation to the nitrogen cycling is only little explored. We hypothesized that improved physical and mechanical soil properties, which are directly linked to soil structure, lead to lower nitrogen losses in an agricultural system. Water holding capacity, total pore volume, bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, shear stress and pre-compression stress were quantiﬁed in the topsoil of three surveys located in Germany on diﬀerent soil types: Eutric Gleyic Cambisol (Loamic) (Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt), Haplic Luvisol (Neubrandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) and Eutric Cambisol (Loamic) (Puch, Bavaria). The ﬁeld experiments were arranged in a Randomized Complete Block Design and treated with two diﬀerent rates of lime (calcium carbonate). Furthermore, three rates of nitrogen in form of urea or calcium ammonium nitrate were applied every year. Liming signiﬁcantly increased the pH, plant available water capacity, total pore volume and decreased bulk density in the soils six months after application, but twelve months after lime application the soil structure collapsed again causes by ploughing and chiseling. We, therefore, assume a positive inﬂuence of lime application on soil physical parameters, if tillage is excluded at least initially. On the other hand, our results from the shear stress parameters and the pre-compression stress values indicate that their changes need time and we assume that it may take several years to develop a sustainable structure system.},

These tractive elements also vary in the way that they impact the soil with some causing more soil disturbance than others. This soil disturbance includes soil compaction and rut formation which negatively impacts rainfall inﬁltration, rooting, and crop production while potentially increasing soil erosion and runoﬀ. This paper will review a portion of the agricultural research that has been conducted related to soil impacts caused by the use of vehicle traﬃc in agricultural ﬁelds. Recommendations will also be made for ways to minimize the eﬀects of vehicle traﬃc on soils when traﬃcking is necessary. These include: reducing axle load; reducing tractive element–soil contact stress by using radial tires, duals, and tracks; increasing soil drying prior to traﬃc; using conservation tillage systems which minimize vehicle traﬃc; using controlled traﬃc systems which eliminate random vehicle traﬃc across ﬁelds; and subsoiling to eliminate compacted soil proﬁles in crop growth zones. Soil compaction resulting from vehicle traﬃc may not be able to be completely eliminated, but it can be controlled and reduced through intelligent management of vehicle traﬃc.},

However, deformation of soil structure may occur at high angular velocities in the centrifuge. The objective of this study was to capture these changes in soil structure with X-ray microtomography and to measure local deformations via digital volume correlation. Two samples were investigated that differ in texture and rock content. A detailed analysis of the pore space reveals an interplay between shrinkage due to drying and soil compaction due to compression. Macroporosity increases at moderate angular velocity because of crack formation due to moisture release. At higher angular velocities, corresponding to capillary pressure of \textit{ψ} \&lt; \&minus;100{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}kPa, macroporosity decreases again because of structure deformation due to compression. While volume changes due to swelling clay minerals are immanent in any drying process, the compaction of soil is a specific drawback of the centrifugation method. A new protocol for digital volume correlation was developed to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of deformation. In both samples the displacement of soil constituents is highest in the top part of the sample and exhibits high lateral variability explained by the spatial distribution of macropores in the sample. Centrifugation should therefore only be applied after the completion of all other hydraulic or thermal experiments, or any other analysis that depends on the integrity of soil structure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Assim, após a adesão do Brasil à OMC e, por consequência, ao TRIPS, um novo impulso é dado a esta temática em face da determinação prevista neste acordo de se proteger plantas seja por meio de patentes seja por meio de um sistema sui generis. O resultado é a Lei n. 9.456, de 25 de abril de 1997 (Lei de Proteção de Cultivar – LPC). A proteção prevista para novas cultivares e cultivares essencialmente derivadas tem a duração de 15 anos, como regra, e 18 para videiras, árvores frutíferas, árvores florestais e árvores ornamentais e seus porta-enxertos, conforme estabelece o artigo 11 da LPC. A proteção de cultivares, como nos demais direitos relacionados à propriedade industrial, é territorial, ou seja, é limitado ao país no qual foi feito o pedido de proteção da cultivar. Esta proteção não abrange a planta, mas apenas o material de reprodução ou multiplicação vegetativa. Ao SNPC (MAPA) compete proteger os cultivares no Brasil, sendo ele responsável por aplicar a Lei n. 9.456, de 1997; fazer a análise de pedidos e conceder os certificados de proteção e zelar pelo cumprimento dos ordenamentos internacionais.  Ele é, de acordo com o Ministério da Agricultura, Pecuária e Abastecimento, um serviço no qual se reconhece a propriedade intelectual sobre uma nova cultivar, resultante de um trabalho de melhoramento genético vegetal e/ou engenharia genética. Ainda, o Registro Nacional de Cultivares (RNC), também ligado ao MAPA, tem por finalidade habilitar previamente cultivares e espécies para a produção e a comercialização de sementes e mudas no País, independente do grupo a qual pertencem – florestais, forrageiras, frutíferas, grandes culturas, olerícolas, ornamentais e outros. Uma nova cultivar representa mais do que um caminho de oportunidades, de negócios e de investimentos na busca constante das transformações no campo da propriedade intelectual e do desenvolvimento biotecnológico; constitui valioso instrumento propulsor do desenvolvimento sustentável, merecendo ser observada como um mecanismo estratégico de inserção das regiões produtivas, voltadas ao setor agrícola, proporcionando benefícios diretos e indiretos para toda a sociedade.},

	abstract = {This work aimed to evaluate soil resistance to penetration by means of a constant-speed electronic penetrograph, in two soils: a clay-textured Rhodic Haplustox and a loamy-textured Typic Haplustox, under mechanization and transportation processes in a sugarcane crop as a function of different numbers of cuts and different working depths. The data were statistically analyzed under two formats: (a) by means of conventional statistics, in which the treatment means were compared by Tukey test at 5\% probability level, and (b) by geostatistical analysis, in which semivariance was used to produce models that would represent the spatial dependence of the data. The resistance to penetration results showed distinct behaviors for the studied depths, indicating that the weight of vehicles and machinery and the rotating wheel pressure caused alterations in the soil profile.},

	abstract = {A compactação do solo diminui o crescimento radicular, podendo afetar tanto o desenvolvimento quanto a produtividade da soja. No presente trabalho, estudaram-se os efeitos da compactação subsuperficial na morfologia radicular da soja (Glycine max L. Merrill), procurando relacioná-los ao crescimento e à nutrição da planta. O 'Primavera' foi cultivado até os 37 dias da emergência, em vasos onde a camada de 15-18,5 cm de profundidade foi campactada a 1,03, 1,25, 1,48 e 1,72 g/cm³, em um latossolo vermelho-escuro com 80\% de areia e 16\% de argila e cuja compactação em subsuperfície levou a um acúmulo de raízes na camada superficial do vaso, sem grandes conseqüências na nutrição da planta. Na densidade aparente de 1,72 g/cm3, as raízes não conseguiram penetrar, embora já houvesse alguma restrição ao crescimento na densidade de 1,25 g/cm³. Quando a camada compactada apresentava resistência à penetração de 0,69 MPa, houve uma redução de 50\% no crescimento radicular da soja.},

	abstract = {Montou-se um experimento, em um Latossolo Vermelho-Escuro Álico, localizado no Centro Nacional de Pesquisa de Milho e Sorgo, para verificar o comportamento da compactação em virtude das diferentes pressões aplicadas ao solo pelo tráfego de tratores. A compactação foi quantificada pelo aumento da densidade aparente nas faixas compactadas pelos pneus dos tratores e os teores de umidade do solo foram pré-estabelecidos com base na curva de compactação obtida pelo Ensaio Normal de Compactação, em laboratório. Procurou-se também, para os tratamentos estudados, comparar a compactação obtida no campo com a determinada em laboratório, na tentativa de verificar a possibilidade de uso do método de laboratório na predição da compactação em campo. Pelos resultados, pode-se verificar que o efeito do tráfego e das pressões de contato estudadas não elevou a compactação do solo a níveis prejudiciais à porosidade de aeração, em nenhum dos dois níveis de umidade. Entretanto, o aumento da umidade do solo (-0,18 MPa para -0,06 MPa) promoveu maior compactação. Os resultados obtidos indicam a possibilidade de uso do Ensaio Normal de Compactação para predição da compactação em campo.},

	abstract = {Conduziu-se um experimento com integração lavoura-pecuária em Latossolo Vermelho distroférrico para avaliar o esforço de tração em hastes sulcadoras de adubo utilizadas em semeadura direta, atuando em diferentes profundidades e intensidades de pastejo, bem como o efeito desse último fator sobre o estado de compactação do solo. Os tratamentos principais foram constituídos pelas alturas da pastagem de inverno (aveia + azevém): 0,10; 0,20; 0,30 e 0,40 m e sem pastejo, obtidas variando-se a carga animal, e os tratamentos secundários foram duas profundidades de atuação da haste sulcadora de adubo: 0,12 e 0,15 m. A massa seca de raízes da pastagem, na camada de 0 a 0,12 m, aumentou com o incremento na intensidade de pastejo. Analisando os valores de resistência mecânica do solo à penetração, o efeito do pastejo foi detectado até 0,12 m, sendo crescentes com a intensidade de pastejo. A força de tração demandada pelas hastes aumentou de 1.900 para 4.300 N (120\%), quando a profundidade de trabalho passou de 0,12 para 0,15 m.  O esforço de tração nas hastes sulcadoras também foi maior quanto maior a carga de animais sobre a pastagem, embora as diferenças tenham sido significativas apenas entre os tratamentos sem pastejo e os mantidos a alturas de 0,10 e 0,20 m. Os valores de resistência do solo à penetração e de esforço de tração demandado pelas hastes sulcadoras apresentaram correlação significativa.},
